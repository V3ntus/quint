"ah, hahaha, four, three, two, one, boom. thank you, thanks for doing this. man really appreciate it. hey, welcome, it's very good to meet you. nice to meet you too. thanks for not lighting this place on fire. you're welcome later. how does one, um, just in the middle of doing all the things you do- uh, create cars, uh, rockets, all this stuff you're doing, constantly innovating- decide to just make a flamethrower? where do you have the time for that? well, the family i wouldn't put. we didn't put a lot of time into the flamethrower, the- this was an off-the-cuff thing, and, um, so we have sort of- like it's sort of a sort of a hobby company called the boring company, uh, which started out as a joke and we decided to make it real and and dig a tunnel under la, and then then people, other people, asked us to take tunnels, and so we said yes in a few cases. and then we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time, and we started off with a cap and there was only one thing on. it was just boringcompanycom. cap or hat, that's it. and and then we sold the hats- limited, limited edition. it just said the boring company. and then i'm big fan of space balls- the movie- and in space balls, yogurt goes through the merchandising section and they have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of spaceballs and, like, the kids love that one. uh, that's the line when he pulls out the flamethrower. it's like we should do a flamethrower. so we does anybody tell you no? does anybody go, elon, um, maybe for yourself, but selling a flamethrower, the liabilities, all the people you're selling this device to- what kind of unhinged people are going to be buying a flamethrower in the first place? do we really want to connect ourselves to all these potential arsonists? yeah, it's a terrible idea, terrible. i shouldn't buy one. i don't. i said: don't buy this plane thrower, don't buy it, don't buy it. that's what i said. but still, people bought it. yeah, there's nothing i can do to staff them. it's building. i said: don't buy it, it's a bad idea. how many did you make? it's dangerous, it's got, it's wrong. don't buy it. still, people bought it. i just couldn't stop them. how many did you make? 20 000. and they're all gone in three, i think four days. but it's sold out in four days. are you going to do a? a another run? no, no, that's it. yes, i said we'll do 20. we did 50 000, 50 000 hats, um and and um. that was a million dollars and it's like, okay, we'll, we'll sell something. and for 10 million, and that was 20 000 flamethrowers at 500 each. they went fast. how do you have the time to do that though? i mean, i understand that it's not a big deal in terms of all the other things you do, but how do you have time to do anything? i just, i don't understand your time management skills. i, i mean, i didn't spend much time on on this flamethrower. i mean, to be totally frank, it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover. it's not a real flamethrower, which is why it says not a flamethrower. that's why we were very clear: this is not actually a flamethrower. and and also we're told, uh, that various countries would, would ban shipping of it, but they would not. they would ban flamethrowers. so we very to solve this problem for all the customs agencies. we labeled it not at flamethrower. did it work? is it effective? i, i, i don't know. i think so. yeah, so far. yes, now, but you said you cannot serve a flamethrower, but you do so many different things. forget about the flamethrower. like, how do you do all that other [ __ ] like, how do you, how do you, how does one decide to fix la traffic by drilling holes in the ground? and who do you even approach with that? like, when you have this idea, who do you talk to about that? i mean, i'm not saying it's going to be successful, or so you know it's like asserting that it's going to be successful, but so far i've lived in la for 16 years and the traffic has always been terrible, and so i don't see any other like ideas for improving the traffic. so, in desperation, we're going to take a tunnel and maybe that tunnel will be successful and maybe it won't. i'm, i'm listening. yeah, i'm not trying to convince you. it's going to work, and are the people or anyone, but you're, you're starting this, though. this is actually a project you're starting to implement, right? yeah, i know we've dug um about a mile. it's quite long. it takes a long time to walk it. yeah, now, when you're doing this, what is the ultimate plan? the ultimate plan is to have these in major cities and anywhere there's mass congestion, and just try it out in la first. yeah, it's, it's in la, because, uh, i mostly live in la. that's the reason it's a terrible place to dig tunnels. this is one of the worst places to dig tunnels because the there's mostly because of the paperwork. people think it's like what about seismic? it's like, actually, earth tunnels are very safe in earthquakes. why is that earthquakes are? earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon. it's like like waves on the ocean, so if there's a storm, you want to be on the on in a submarine. so being in a tunnel is like being a submarine. now, the way the tunnel is constructed is it's constructed out of these interlocking segments, kind of like a snake. it's sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals, and so even when the ground moves, the it's able to. the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake, and it doesn't crack or break or or and and it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. and it's it's it's capable of taking five atmospheres of pressure. it's waterproof, methane proof or gas proof of any kind, and uh meets all california seismic requirements. so when you have this idea, who do you bring this to? i'm not sure what you mean by that. well, when you you're, you're implementing it. so you're digging holes in the ground, like you have to bring it to someone that lets you do it. yeah, so, um, there were, there were some engineers from spacex, um, who were, who thought it would be cool to do this. uh, and the guy who runs it like day-to-day- steve davis- he's a long-time spacex engineer- is great, um. so steve was like i'd like to help make this happen. i was like cool, um, so we started off with digging a hole in the ground. it's got like a permit for a pit, big pit, and just dug a big pit, and you have to tell them what the pit's for. or you just say, hey, we just want to dig a hole, nice, fill out this form, that's it. yeah, i was put in our parking lot and, but do you have to give them some sort of a blueprint for your ultimate idea and do they have to approve it? like, how does that work? now? we just started off with a pit, okay, big pit. and, um, now you know it's not really, you know, don't really care about the existential nature of a pit. you just say like i don't want a bit, right, yeah, and uh, it's a hole in the ground. so then we got the permit for the pit and we dug the pit and we dug in like i don't know, three days, two, three days actually, i think two, 48 hours, something like that. um, because uh, eric garcetti was coming by for the hype to, he was going to attend the hyperloop competition, which is like a student competition we have for uh, who can make the fastest pod in the hyperloop. and uh, he was coming, this was good, the finals were going to be on sunday afternoon and so eric was coming by on sunday afternoon, was like you know, we should take this pit. and then like show eric. uh, so we was like friday morning and then, yeah, so it was about a little over 40 hours, 40 hours later we dug the pit- it was like when 24, 7 or 24, 48 straight hours, something like that- and dug this big pit and and and we're like showed eric the pit, like obviously it's just a pit, but hey, it's hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground. and what do you tell me about this pit? i mean you said this is the beginning of this idea. yes, we're going to build tunnels under la to help funnel traffic better, and there you go and they just go. okay, that, but that we've joked around about this in the podcast before- that, like, what other person can go to the people that run the city and go, hey, uh, we're gonna dig some holes on the ground and put some tunnels in there. and they go, oh, yeah, okay, now they know where they're holding the ground. but it's uh, people think holes in the ground all the time. but my, my question is: like: i know how much time you must be spending on your tesla factory, i know how much time you must be spending on spacex and yet you still have time to dig holes under the ground in la and come up with these ideas and then implement them. like i got a million ideas. i'm sure you did no shortage of that. yeah, i just don't know how you manage your time. i don't understand it. it doesn't seem, it doesn't even seem humanly possible. you know, i, i do. basically, i think people like don't totally understand what i do with my time. they think like i'm a business guy or something like that. um, like my wikipedia page says: business magnate, what would you call yourself? a business magnet? can someone please change my wikipedia page to magnet? they'll change it right now. it's probably already changed. it's locked, so somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnets. i want to be a magnet. no, i. i do engineering and you know, and manufacturing and that kind of thing. that's like 80 percent more of my time. ideas and then the implementation of those ideas. that's like hardcore engineering, like, yeah, designing things, you know right, structural, mechanical, electrical, software, uh, user interface engineering, aerospace engineering. but you must understand there's not a whole lot of human beings like you. you know that, right, you're an oddity. yes, to chimps like me. we're all chimps, yeah, we are. we're one notch. we're not above a chimp. some of us are a little more confused. when i watch you doing all these things, i'm like, how does this [ __ ] have all this time and all this energy and all these ideas? and then people just let them do these things because i'm an alien. that's what i've speculated. yes, i'm on record saying this in the past. i wonder, it's true, if there was one, i was like. if there was, like maybe an intelligent being that we created, you know, like some ai creature that's uh, superior to people, maybe just hang around with us for a little while, like you've been doing, and then fix a bunch of [ __ ]. maybe that's the way i might have some mutation or something like that you might do. you think you do, probably do you wonder? like you're around normal people, you're like, hmm, like what's up with these boring, dumb [ __ ]? ever not bad for a human, but i, i think we will not be able to hold a candle to ai. hmm, you scare the [ __ ] out of me when you talk about ai between you and sam harris. i don't even consider it until at a podcast with sam once- right, he made me [ __ ] my pants talking about ai. i realized like, oh well, this is a genie, that once it's out of the bottle, you're never getting it back in. that's true. there was a video that you tweeted about one of those boston dynamic robots and you're like, in the future it'll be moving so fast you can't see it without a strobe light. yeah, you could probably do that right now and no one's really, uh, paying attention too much, other than people like you or people that are really obsessed with technology. all these things are happening and these robots are. did you see the one where peta put out a statement that you shouldn't kick robots? it's probably not wise for retribution. their memory is very good. i bet it's really good. it's really good, i bet it is. yes, and getting better every day. it's really good. are you honestly, legitimately concerned about this? are you? is like ai one of your main worries in regards to the future? yes, it, it's less of a worry than it used to be, mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude [Music]. so you used to have more hope and you gave up some of it, and now you don't worry as much about ai. you're like: this is just what it is. yeah, pretty much. yes, yes, but no, it's not necessarily bad, it's just it's definitely going to be outside of human control. not necessarily bad, right? yeah, it's not. it's not necessarily bad, it's just it's just outside of human control. now the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very tempting to use ai as a weapon. it's going to be very tempting. in fact, it will be used as a weapon. so the the on the the on ramp to serious ai. the danger is going to be more humans using it against each other. i think most likely that'll be the danger. yeah, how far do you think we are from something that can make its own mind up whether or not something's ethically or morally correct, or whether or not it wants to do something, or whether or not it wants to improve itself, or whether or not it wants to protect itself from people or from other. ai, how far away we, some from something that's really truly sentient. well, i mean, you could argue that any group of people like it like a company, is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines. that's what a company is, and then there are different, there's different levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed, and then there are sort of there's this like a collective ai in in the google sort of search- google search, you know the- where we're all sort of plugged in as like, like nerds on the network, like leaves on a big tree or, and we're all feeding this network without questions and answers. we're all collectively programming. the ai and the and google plus the older humans that connect to it are one giant cybernetic collective. this is also true of facebook and twitter and instagram and all these social networks. they're giant cybernetic collectives- humans and electronics, all interfacing and constantly, now constantly- connected- yes, constantly. one of the things that i've been thinking about a lot over the last few years is that one of the things that drives a lot of people crazy is how, how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the latest, greatest thing, and i wonder how much of that is well, a lot of it is most certainly fueling technology and innovation. it almost seems like it's built into us. it's like what we like and what we want, that we're fueling this thing that's constantly around us all the time, and it doesn't seem possible that people are going to pump the brakes. it doesn't seem possible at this stage. we're constantly expecting a new cell phone, the latest tesla update, the newest macbook pro. everything has to be newer and better, and that's going to lead to some incredible point, and it seems like it's built into us. it almost seems like it's an instinct that we we're working towards this, that we like it. our job, just like the ants build the ant hill, our job- is to somehow rather fuel this. yes, um, i mean i made this comment some some years ago, but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for ai. effectively, we are building it and then we're building progressively greater intelligence and the percentage of intelligence that is not human is increasing and eventually we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence. but the, the ai, isn't formed, strangely, by the human limbic system. it is in large part, our id writ large. how so we mention all those things, the sort of primal drives? um, there's all all the things that we like and hate and fear. they're all there on the internet, their projection of our limbic system. [Music]. that's true. no, it makes sense. and the thinking of it as a- i mean think of thinking of corporations and just thinking of just human beings communicating online through these social media networks is some sort of an organism. that's a. it's a cyborg. it's a. it's a combination. it's a combination of electronics and biology. yeah, this is in some measure, like it's. the success of these online systems is the is a is sort of a function of of how much limbic resonance they're able to achieve with people. the more limited resonance, the more engagement, um, whereas, like one of the reasons why, probably, instagram is more enticing than twitter, olympic resonance, yeah, you get more images, more video, yes, tweaking your system more? yes, do you worry about, or wonder, in fact, about, what the next step is? i mean, a lot of people didn't see twitter coming that you know, communicate with 140 characters or 280 now would be a thing that people would be interested in, like, it's gonna excel, it's gonna become more connected to us, right? yes, things are getting more and more connected. they're, at this point, constrained by bandwidth. our input output is slow. particularly output output got worse with thumbs. you know we just have input with 10, 10 fingers. now we have thumbs, but images are just are also, are there a way of communicating at high bandwidth? you take pictures and you send pictures to people. what sends that's? that communicates far more information than you can communicate with your thumbs. so what happened with you where you decided or you took on a more fatalistic attitude like what? was there any specific thing or was it just the inevitability of our future? i try to convince people to slow down. slow down ai, to regulate ai. this was futile. i tried for years. this scene nobody's seen in a movie. robots are gonna [ __ ] take over and you're freaking me out. nobody listened. nobody listens, no one. are people more inclined to listen today? it seems like an issue that's brought up more often over the last few years than it was maybe five, ten years ago. it seemed like science fiction. maybe they will. so far they haven't. i think people don't like the normally the way that regulations work. it's very slow. it's very slow indeed. so usually it'll be something, some new technology, it will cause damage or death. there will be an outcry, there will be an investigation, years will pass, there will be some sort of insight committee, there will be rule making, then there will be oversight. eventually, regulations. this all takes many years. this is the normal course of things. if you look at, say, automotive regulations, how long did it take for seat belts to be, to be implemented, to be required? you know, the water industry fought seat belts, i think for more than a decade, successfully, fought any regulations on seat belts, even though the numbers were extremely obvious. if you had a seatbelt on, you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured. it was unequivocal and the industry fought this for years successfully. eventually, after many, many people died, regulators insisted on seat belts. this is a. this time frame is not relevant to ai. you can't take 10 years from the point which is dangerous. it's too late and you feel like this is decades away or years away from being too late. if you have this fatalistic attitude and you feel like it's going. we're in a almost like a doomsday countdown. it's not necessarily a doomsday countdown, it's. it's a out of control countdown. out of control, yeah, people call it the singularity and uh, that's, that's probably thing about it. is, it's a singular. it's hard to predict, like a black hole, what, what happens past the event horizon, right. so once it's implemented, it's very different, because it it once it's out of the bottle, what's going to happen and it will be able to improve itself. yes, that's where it gets spooky, right, the idea that it can do thousands of years of innovation very, very quickly. yeah, and then we'll be just ridiculous, ridiculous. we will be like this ridiculous biological [ __ ] pissing thing trying to stop the gods. no, stop, we like. we like living with a finite lifespan and watching, you know, norman rockwell paintings. it could be terrible and it could be great. it's not clear, right, but one thing is for sure: we will not control it. do you think that it's likely that we will merge somehow or another with this sort of technology and it'll augment what we are now, or do you think it will replace us? well, that's the scenario. the the emerge scenario with ai is the one that seems like probably the best like for us, yes, like if you, if you can't beat it, join it. that's yeah, you know. um, so from a long-term, existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of neural link is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbolic with ai, because we have a bandwidth problem. you just can't communicate through your fingers is too slow, and where is neural link at right now? i think we'll have something interesting to announce in a few months. that's at least an order of magnitude better than anything else, probably, i think, better than probably, if anyone thinks is possible. how much can you talk about that right now? i don't want to drop the gun on that, um, but what's like the ultimate, what's, what's the idea behind it? like, what are you trying to accomplish with it? like, what would you like? best case scenario? i think best case scenario we effectively emerge with ai, where we ais serves as a tertiary cognition layer, uh, where we've got the limbic system, kind of the primitive brain. essentially you've got the cortex, so you're currently in a symbiotic relationship with your cortex and limbic system are in a symbolic relationship and generally people like their cortex and they like the olympic system. i haven't met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex. everybody seems to like both, and the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. people may think that that that they're, that they're thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it's mostly their limbic system that's in charge, and the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. that's what most of that computing power is oriented towards. how can i make the limbic system happy? that's what i was trying to do. now, if we do have a third layer, which is the ai extension of yourself, that is also symbiotic and there's enough bandwidth between the cortex and the ai extension of yourself, such that the ai doesn't de facto separate, then that could be a good outcome. that could be quite a positive outcome for the future. so, instead of replacing us, it will radically change our capabilities. yes, it will enable anyone who wants to have superhuman cognition, anyone who wants. this is not a matter of earning power, because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it. so it's just like anyone who wants can just do it in theory. that's the theory. and and if that's the case, then- and let's say billions of people do it- then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of of human will, the sum of billions of people's desire for the future, billions of people with enhanced cognitive ability, radically enhanced, yes, and which would be it. how much different than people today, like, if you, if you had to explain it to a person who didn't really understand what you were saying, how much different are you talking about? when you say radically improve, like, what do you mean? you mean mind reading difficult? it will be difficult to to really appreciate the difference. um, it's kind of like: how much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without? it's your vastly smarter, actually, you know, you can answer any question. if you connect to the internet, you can answer any question pretty much instantly. any calculation that your phone's memory is essentially perfect, uh, you can remember flawlessly. your phone can remember videos, pictures and everything perfectly. that's the, that your phone is already an extension of you. you're already a cyborg. you don't even well, most people realize they are already a cyborg. it, that phone is an extension of yourself. it's just that the, the data rate, the rate at which of the communication rate between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself, that is, your phone and computer is slow, it's very slow and and that that it's like a tiny straw of of information flow between your biological self and your digital self and we need to make that tiny straw like a giant river, huge, high bandwidth interface. it's an interface problem, data rate problem. solve the data rate problem, then i think i think we can hang on to human machine symbiosis through the long term and then people may decide that they want to retain their biological self or not. i think they'll probably choose to retain their biological self versus some sort of ray kurzweil scenario where they download themselves into a computer. you will be essentially snapshotted into a computer at any time. if your biological self dies, you could just probably just upload into a new unit. literally pass that whiskey. we're getting crazy over here. this is getting ridiculous down the rabbit hole. grab that sucker, give me some of that. this is too freaky. see if i've been thinking about this for a long time. by the way, i believe you have if i was talking to one. cheers, by the way, cheers. hey, this is a great whiskey. thank you, i know where this came from. who brought this to us? trying to remember, somebody gave it to us, old camp. whoever it was: thanks, yeah, it is good. um, this is just inevitable. again, going back to your when you decided to have this fatalistic viewpoint, so you weren't you tried to warn people. you talked about this pretty extensively. i've read several interviews where you talked about this and then you just sort of just said, okay, it just is, let's just- and you, in a way, you're, by communicating the potential fear, i mean for sure you're, you're getting the warning out to some people. yeah, yeah, i mean i, i was really going on the warning quite, quite a lot. i was warning everyone. i could, even met with obama and just for one reason, like, just talk about ai, yes, and what did he say? so what about hillary? worry about her first shh? everybody crying? no, he listened. he suddenly listened. um, i met with congress. i met with, i was at a meeting of all 50 governors and talked about just ai danger, and i talked to everyone. i could. no one seemed to realize where this was going. is it that? or do they just assume that someone smarter than them has already taken care of it? because when people hear about something like ai, it's almost abstract, it's almost, it's almost like it's so. it's so hard to wrap your head around it. by the time it already happens it'll be too late. yeah, i think they didn't quite understand it or didn't think it was near term or not sure what to do about it, when i said, like you know, an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight. you know, before, before you oversight, before you do make regulations, they should try to understand what's going on. and then, if you have a insight committee, then once they learn what's going on, get up to speed, then they can make maybe some rules or propose some rules, and and that would be probably a safer way to go about things. it seems- i mean, i know that it's probably something that the government's supposed to handle, but it seems like i wouldn't want the, i don't want the government to handle this. who do you want to? i want you to handle it. oh, geez, yeah, i feel like you're the one who could ring the bell better. because if, if mike pence starts talking about, hey, i'm like shut up [ __ ]. you don't know anything about ai, come on, man, he doesn't know what he's talking about, but i don't have the power to regulate other companies. what am i supposed to do right, but maybe companies could agree. maybe there could be some sort of a there's we have agreements where you're not supposed to dump toxic waste into the ocean. you're not supposed to do certain things that could be terribly damaging, even though they'd be profitable. maybe this is one of those things. maybe you should realize that you can't hit the switch on something that's going to be able to think for itself and make up its own mind as to whether or not it wants to survive or not, and whether or not it thinks you're a threat and whether or not it thinks you're useless. like, why do i keep this dumb, finite life form alive? why? why keep this thing around? it's just stupid. it just keeps polluting everything. it's [ __ ] everywhere it goes, lighting everything on fire and shooting each other. why would i keep this stupid thing alive? because sometimes it makes good music, you know. sometimes it makes great movies, sometimes it makes beautiful art and sometimes, you know, sometimes it's cool to hang out with. like, yeah, all those reasons, yeah, for us those are great reasons, yes, but for anything objective standing outside, like, oh, this is definitely a flawed system. this is like if you went to the jungle and you watch these chimps engage in warfare and beat each other with music. they're [ __ ] really mean. [ __ ] mean they're real meaning. i saw that movie: chimpanzee. yeah, i thought it was gonna be like some disney things like holy cow. what movie was that? it's literally called chimpanzee. is it a documentary? yeah, yeah, it's kind of like a documentary. i was like, damn, these chimps are mean. they're mean. yeah, they're cruel. yeah, they're they're. they're calculated. yeah, yeah, they sneak up on each other and, like i didn't realize, chimps did calculated cruelty. mm-hmm, yeah, that's pretty. ah, i left that meeting kind of thinking, whoa, this is dark. right, well, we know better because we've advanced, but if we hadn't, we'd be like man, i don't want to [ __ ] live in a house. i like the chimp ways, bro, chimp ways to go. this is it man, chimp life, i know. but we, in a way to the ai, might be like those chimps. i'm like these stupid [ __ ] launching missiles out of drones and shooting each other under water. like we're crazy. we got torpedoes and submarines and [ __ ] airplanes that drop nuclear bombs indiscriminately on cities. we're [ __ ]. yeah, they might go. why are they doing this? it might like: look at our politics, look at what we do in terms of our, our food system, what, what kind of food we force down each other's throats, and they might go. these people are crazy. they don't even look out for themselves, i don't know. i mean, how much do we think about chimps? not much, very little. it's like these terms are at war, these like little. it's like groups of chimps just attack each other and they kill each other and they torture each other. that's pretty bad. um, they hunt monkeys? uh, they're, but like, this is probably the most that's. you know. i mean, when's the last time you talk about chimps- me? yeah, all the time you do talking to them, okay [ __ ]. podcast dude. okay, people are laughing right now. yeah, constantly, i'm obsessed. i saw that david attenborough documentary on champs where they were eating those columbus monkeys and ripping them apart. i saw that many, many years ago. it just changed how i go. oh, this is why people are so crazy. we came from that thing. yeah, exactly, yeah. and there's the yeah, they got like better philosophy. yeah, they're like swingers. yeah, yeah, they really are. they're they. they seem to be way more even than us, way more civilized. they just seem to resolve everything with sex. yeah, the only rules they have is: the mom won't bang the sun, that's it, okay, that's it. mom won't bring her sons. they're good women, yeah, good women in the bonobo community. everybody else just banging it out. yeah, i haven't seen the bonovo movie [Laughter]. well, they're disturbing, just at a zoo. you know, you have bonobos at the zoo. they're just constantly going, constantly [ __ ]. yeah, that's all they do. they just won't stop. yeah, and they don't care. gay, straight, whatever. let's just up these labels. i haven't seen bonobos out of zero. it's probably like nothing, nothing, not in the pg section. yeah, i don't think they have them at many zoos. we've looked at it before. it's probably pretty awkward. i think that's the thing they like: to keep regular chimps at zoos, because bonobos are just always jacking off. yeah, what's that? they're in san diego. san diego's got some yet really interesting, probably separate them. yeah, i mean, how many are in a cage? you know, it's like right, it's gonna be pretty intense, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're. we're a weird thing, you know, and i've often wondered if, whether or not we're. you know, our ultimate goal is to give birth to some new thing, and that's why we're so obsessed with technology, because it's not like this technology is really. i mean, it's certainly enhancing our lives to in a certain way, but is, i mean, ultimately, is it making people happier? right now, most technology? i would say no. in fact, you and i were talking about social media before this, about just not having instagram on your phone and not dealing. you feel better. yes, i think that one of the issues with social media that's been pointed out by many people is that i think, maybe particularly instagram, um, people look like they have a much better life than they really do, right? so, by design, yeah, people are posting pictures of when they're really happy. they're modifying those pictures to be better looking. even if they're not modifying the pictures, they're at least selecting the pictures for the best lighting, the best angle. so people basically seem, uh, they're way better looking than they basically really are, right, um, and they're way happier seeming than they really are. so if you look at everyone on instagram, you might think, man, they're all these happy, beautiful people and i'm not that good looking and i'm not happy, so i'm a suck, you know, and that's gonna make feel sad. so when, in fact, those people you think are super happy, actually not that happy. some of them are really depressed. they're very sad. some of the happiest seeming people, actually some of the saddest people in reality, um, and, and nobody looks good all the time, doesn't matter who you are. no, it's not even something you should want. why do you want to look great all the time? yeah, exactly so. uh, so i think i think things like that can make people quite sad, just by comparison, because you, you sort of you, people, people generally think of themselves relative to to others. it's, it's a. we are constantly re-re-baselining our expectations. um, and you can see this, say, if you watch some show like naked and afraid, or you know, if you just go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while and you're like the learned: civilization is quite great, it has a lot, it's a lot of it. it's people want to come back. civilization pretty fast on the good and afraid. wasn't that a thoreau quote? the comparison is a thief of joy. yeah, well, if happiness is reality, minus expectations, that's great too. but the comparison is a thief of joy really holds true to people, is it? theodore roosevelt, roosevelt, fascinating. um, and when you're thinking about instagram, because what essentially instagram is with a lot of people is you're giving them the opportunity to be their own pr agent and they always go towards the glamorous you know, and when any anybody does show you know, hashtag, no filter. i don't know if they really do do that like: oh, you're so brave, look at you- no makeup, you know. yeah, they look good anyway, you look great. what are you doing? oh, my god, you don't have makeup on. you still look hot as [ __ ]. you know what you're doing, i know what you're doing too. they're, they're, they're letting you know and then they're feeding off that comment section, sitting there, like, like it's a fresh stream of love, like you're getting right up to the source as it comes out of the earth and you're sucking. that's a lot of a lot of emojis, emojis, emojis. yeah, a lot of emojis. my, my concern is not so much what instagram is, is that i didn't think that people had the need for this or the expectation for some sort of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation from strangers and comments and and this ability to project this sort of distorted version of who you really are. but i worry about where it goes like: what's the next one? what's the next one like? where is it? is it going to be augmented to some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of instagram type situation where you're not going to want to live in this real world, you're going to want to interface with this sort of world that you've created through your social media page, some next level thing? yeah, go live in the simulation. yeah, i mean in the simulation. some ready player, one type [ __ ]. that's real, that seems. we have that htc vive here and i've only done it a couple times, quite honestly, because it kind of freaks me out. sure, my kids [ __ ] love it, man, they love it. they love playing these weirdo games and and walking around with that headset on. but part of me watching them do it goes, wow, i wonder if this is like the precursor, just sort of like, if you look at that, that phone that gordon gekko had on the beach- yeah, big cell phone, yeah, you compare that to like a galaxy note 9.. how the [ __ ] did that become that right? and i wonder, when i see this htc vive, i'm like what is that thing going to be 10 years from now, when we're making fun of what it is now. what is it? how? i mean how ingrained and how? how? how connected and interconnected is this technology going to be in our life? it will be at some point indistinguishable from reality, where we'll lose this, we lose this, like you and i are just looking at each other through our eyes. i see where you see me, i think. i hope you think so. i think you probably have a regular eyes. this could be some simulation. it could do you entertain that? well, the argument for the simulation, i think, is quite strong, because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any improvement, one percent, point one percent, just extend the time frame, make it a thousand years, a million years. the universe is 13.8 billion years old. what would a civilization? if you counted, if you're very generous, civilization is maybe seven or eight thousand years old if you count it from the first writing. this is nothing, this is nothing. so if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality or civilization will end. one of those two things will occur. therefore, we are most likely in a simulation or we're on our way to one right. well, just because we exist, we could most certainly be on the road. we could be on the road to that right. it doesn't mean that it has to be reality. it could be in base reality. we could be here now on our way to the road, or on our way to the destination where this can never happen again, where we are completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology or some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the internet or the next level of sharing information. but right now we're not there yet. that's possible too. right, it's possible that a simulation is one day going to be inevitable, that we're going to have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality. but maybe we're not there yet. that's also possible, so we're not quite there yet, that this is real. when i touch that it feels very real. maybe that's why everybody's like into like mason jars and [ __ ] amazing suede shoes. people are going to like craft restaurants and they want raw wood. everyone says everyone wants to see metal people. it seems like people are like longing towards some weird log cabin type nostalgia reality. yeah, like holding on, like clinging, just dragging their nails through the mud, like don't take me yet, yes, but then. but then people go get a mason jar with a wine stem or a handle. that's dark, makes me lose faith in humanity. wine stem and a handle- they have those. yes, oh, those dirty people. that's just [ __ ]. that's like people make pet rocks rough, right, some people are just [ __ ]. they take advantage of our, our generous nature. it was made with a wine stem, made with a handle. they made it that way. yes, so the the? it wasn't like well, on to the mason. ah, that would be fine if there was. they glued it on or something right, white trash, chic. oh, this is disgusting. look at this, it is right there. yep, this is terrible. yeah, that's like fake breasts that are designed to be hard, like fake breasts from the 60s. it's like, if you really along for the ones with ripples, here we go. yeah, that's almost what that is. yeah, what are you going to do, man? there's not nothing. you know something you do: stop certain terrible ideas from propagating. yeah, um, anyway, i don't sound like things are too dark because i think, like you, kind of have to be optimistic about the future. there's no point in being pessimistic. it's just too negative. it doesn't help. you know, i think you want to be. i mean, my theory is, like you'd rather be optimistic. i think i'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right. right, at least, or on that side. right, yeah, because if you're pessimistic it's going to be miserable. yeah, yeah, nobody wants to be around you anyway, if it's the end of the world, you're like i told you, bro, yeah, the world's ending, yeah, it is what it is for all. i mean, enjoy the journey, right, if you really want to get morose, i mean, it is what it is for all of us. anyway, we're all going to go, unless some something changes. yeah, i mean, ultimately, you know, even if we just sort of existed as humans forever, we'd be, would still eventually be like the heat death of the universe, right, a zillion years from now, right, even if we get it past the sun, if we figure out a way past the sun, running out of juice, eventually it's going to end. it's just a question of when, right, so it really is all about the journey, hmm, or transcendence from whatever we are now into something that doesn't worry about death. the universe as we know it will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually, and then someone's going to bottle it and put a fragrance to it, sell it to french people in another dimension. it's just a very long time. so i think it's really just about how can we make it last longer? are you a proponent of the multi-universes theory? do you believe that there are many, many universes and that even if this one fades out, that there's other ones that are starting fresh right now? and there's an infinite number of them, and they're just constantly in this never-ending cycle of birth and death? i think most likely this is just about probability. there are many, many simulations. these simulations are- you might as well call them reality, or you could call them multiverse. these simulations, you believe, are created like someone has manufactured, running on the substrate. so that substrate is probably boring, boring, how so well, when we create a simulation like a game or a movie, it's a distillation of what's interesting about life. you know it takes take a year to shoot an action movie and then that's all to slow down into two or three hours. so let me tell you, if you see an action movie being filmed, it's freaking, it's boring, super boring. it takes there's like lots of takes. there's everything's in a green screen looks pretty goofy, doesn't look cool, but once you add the cgi and have great editing, it's amazing. so i think, most likely, if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation, because why would you make a simulation that's boring? it makes simulation way more interesting than the base reality. that is, if this right now is a simulation, yes, and ultimately, inevitably we're. if, as long as we don't die or get hit by a meteor, we're going to create some sort of simulation. if we continue on the same technological path where we're on right now, yes, but we might not be there yet. so it might not be a simulation here, but it most likely is. you feel, other places, this notion of place or where is, is a flawed, yes, flawed like that. if you have this sort of that, uh, vive, you know which, that's made by valve and st, and it's really valve that made it htc, did the hardware, but it's really a valve thing. um, makers of half-life? yes, wow, great company, great company. um, uh, when you're in the, in that, some, in that, your virtual reality, which is only going to get better, where are you? where are you really right? you aren't anywhere. well, where is the computer? what, what? you know what defines where you are exactly right? it's your perception, is it your perceptions or is it? you know a scale that we have under your butt. you're right here. i've measured you. you're the same weight as you were when you left, but you meanwhile you're experiencing. why do you think you're where you are right now? you might not be. i'll spark up a joint. if you keep talking, your manager's gonna come in here. we might have to lock the door right now. you think you're in a studio in la. that's what i heard. you might be in a computer. oh listen, man, i think about this all the time. yeah, i mean, it's unquestionable that one day that'll be the case as long as we keep going, as long as nothing interrupts us, and if we start from scratch- and you know, we're single-celled organisms all over again- and then millions and millions of years later we become the next thing, that is us, with creativity and the ability to change its environment. it's going to keep monkeying with things until it figures out a way to change reality. to change, i mean to almost like punch a hole through what is this thing into, what, what it wants it to be, and create new things, and then those new things will intersect with other people's new things and it'll be this ultimate pathway of infinite ideas and expression, all through technology. yeah, and then we're one we're gonna wonder, like: why are we here? what are we doing? let's find out. well, i i mean, i think we should take the actions, the set of actions, that are most likely to make the future better. yes, right, yeah, right, right. and then we evaluate those actions to make sure they're they're that it's true. well, i think there's a movement to that, i mean in terms of like, a social movement. i think some of it's misguided and some of it's exaggerated, and there's a lot, of, a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there. but it seems like the general trend of like, uh, social awareness seems to be much more heightened now than has ever been in any other time in history, because of our ability to express ourselves instantaneously to each other through facebook or twitter or what have you, and that the trend is to uh abandon preconceived notions, abandon prejudice, abandon discrimination and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible. look at this knife. somebody gave it to me. sorry, yeah, what is this? the [ __ ] did you do my friend donny? he brought this with him and it just stayed here. i have a real samurai sword if you want to play with that? i know you're into weapons. that's from the 1500s samurai. at the end of the table. yeah, that's cool, i'll grab it. hold on. yeah, that's a legit samurai sword from an actual samurai from the 1500s. if you pull out that blade, that blade was made the old way, where a master craftsman folded that metal and hammered it down over and over again over a long period of time and honed that blade into what it is now. what's crazy is that more than 500 years later, that thing is still pristine. i mean, whoever took care of that and passed it down to the next person who took care of it? and you know, until it got to the podcast room, it's pretty [ __ ] crazy. yeah, one day someone's going to be looking at a tesla like that. these [ __ ] back doors, they pop up sideways like a lamborghini. you should see what tesla can do. uh, you didn't, you should. i'll show you afterwards. well, i've driven one. i love them. yeah, but most people don't know what it can do in terms of, like ludicrous mode, in terms of driving super fast and irresponsibly on public roads. is that what we're saying? well, any call can do that. yeah, what can it do that that i need to know about. i mean, the model x can do this like ballet thing to the trans-siberian orchestra. it's pretty cool where it dances- yes, legitimately moves around. why would you program that into a car? seemed like fun. that's what i get about you. that's what's weird. like when you showed up here you were all smiles and you pull out a [ __ ] blow torch and not a blow torch. but i'm like, look at this dude, a flamethrower, not a flamethrower like you want to be clear. it's definitely not playing. you're having fun like this is uh, like this thing. when you know you program a car to do a ballet dance, it's very fun. how do you have the time to do that? i don't understand why you're digging holes under the earth and centered rockets into space and and powering people in australia. like how the [ __ ] do you have time to make the car dance ballet? well, i mean, in that case there were some engineers at tesla that said you know what, if we make this car dance and play music? i was like that sounds great, please do it. let's try to get it done in time for christmas. we did. is there a concern about someone just losing their mind and making it do that on the highway? no, it won't do that. what if it's in bumper-to-bumper traffic? nope, no, won't do it. nope, it's actually. you have to. it's an easter egg. oh, it's an easter egg. yeah, that's why people don't know about it, including people have the car. well, it's like it can do lots of things, lots of things. once reddit gets a hold of it, everyone's. oh, you just have to. it's everyone. if you search for it on the internet, you will find out, but people don't know that they should even search for it. oh, well, they do now. yes, yes, there's so many things about the model x and the model s and the model 3 that people don't know about. we should probably do a video or something and explain it, because i have close friends of mine and i say: do you know the call can do this? and they're like: nope, do you want to do a video though? do you like the fact that some people don't know? no, i think it's probably not. we should tell people: yeah, probably, yes, that would help your product. i mean, it's not like you don't sell enough of them. you sell almost too many of them, right, the? i mean, i think a tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever. that's what it's meant to be. well, our goal is to make it's. it's not exactly a car, it's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment. electronic, like big screen, laptop, ridiculous speed, handling all that stuff. yeah, do you you have going to put video games in it? you are? yeah, is that wise? well, you won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game, but we're like, for example, we just we're just putting the, the atari emulator, raw emulator- in it so you'll be able to play missile command and lunar lander and a bunch of other things. yeah, that sounds cool. it's pretty fun. i like that. yeah, and we improved the interface and missile command because it's too hard with the old trackball. so this is, this is a touchscreen version of missile command, so you have a chance. [Laughter]. do you? you have an old car, don't you? don't you have, like, an old jaguar? yeah, how do you know that? that's that's what. another uh 61 series, one e-type jaguar. i love cars. it's great. yeah, i love old cars. that's one of the only- yeah, the only two got only two gasoline cars i have of that and an old like a ford model t that a friend of mine gave me. that's. those are only two gasoline cars. is the ford model t all stock? well, oh, there's your car. ooh, look, i have the convertible. that is a cool car, god, that's a good looking car. yes, is that yours? that is, it's not mine. it's extremely close to mine that i don't have a friend's license plate on mine. oh, it's a beautiful car. they nailed it. that's that's mine. looks like that, god. they nailed that. that's what mine looks like. maybe that is mine. there's certain iconic shapes, yes, and there's. there's something about those cars too. they're not as capable, not nearly as capable- as like a tesla, but there's something really satisfying about the mechanical aspect of like feeling the steering and the grinding of the gears and the shifting. there's something about those that's extremely satisfying, even though they're not that competent like. i have a 1993 porsche 964. it's like a lightweight, it's not. it's in the rs america. it's not very fast, it's not like in comparison to a tesla or anything like that, but the thing about it is like it's mechanical, you feel it, everything's like. it's like. it gives you this weird thrill, like you're on this clinky ride and there's all this feedback. there's something to that. yeah, yeah, absolutely. i mean, yeah, my e-type is like basically no electronics. yeah, um, you like that, but you also like electronics. yes, like your tesla is supe, it's like the far end of electronics. yes, drives itself. it's driving itself better every day. yeah, it's like we're about to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on and it'll drive from highway on-ramp to highway exit. do lane changes to overtake other cars, jesus, go from one interchange to the next. if you get on, say, the 405, and get on, get off 300 miles later and go through several highway interchanges and just overtake other cars and hook into the nav system. and then, uh, and you're just meditating home, yeah, your car's just traveling very, it's kind of eerie. it's kind of eerie. what did you think when you saw that video? that dude falling asleep behind the wheel. i'm sure you've seen it, the one in san francisco. he's like right outside of san jose, dudes out, cold like this, and the car is in bumper to bumper traffic moving along. yeah, have you seen it right? yeah, yeah, we changed the software. we changed the software. that's, i think, an old video. we changed software. if, if you don't touch the wheel. it will gradually slow down and put the emergency lights on and wake you up. oh, that's hilarious. yeah, that's hilarious. yeah, can you choose what voice wakes you up? well, it's sort of more of a it sort of honks. oh, it honks. this should be like: wake up [ __ ] face. well, you're endangering your fellow humans. we could, we could, gently wake you up with a sultry voice. ah, that would be good. like, uh, something with a southern accent? hey, why can't we wake up sunshine? hey, sweetie, exactly, why don't you wake up? you're like, pick, you could pick your right. like what do you want? yeah, i choose the australian girl for siri. yeah, i like her voice. do you want to seduce my favorite? i like australian. what flavor of do you want to be angry? could be anything. you want those australian prison lady jeans. now, when you, um, when you program something like that in, is this in response to a concern or is it your own? yeah, if you do, you look at it and go: hey, um, they shouldn't just be able to fall asleep, let's wake them up. yeah, yeah, we, it's like you know. we're like: well, you know, people are just falling asleep. we're about to do something about that right, but when you first released it you didn't consider it right. you're just like, well, no one's gonna just sleep. people fall asleep in cars all the time, all the time, and crash. yeah, at least our car doesn't crash, that's better. it's better not to crash. imagine if that guy had fallen asleep in a, in a gasoline car- they do it all the time, for sure. yeah, they would crash into somebody. yeah, and in fact, the thing that really, you know, got me to it's like man, we better get autopilot going, get it out there. it was a guy was in an early tesla driving down the highway and he fell asleep and he ran over a cyclist and killed him. and it's like i was like man, if we had autopilot, wouldn't run out of one. we might have fallen asleep, but at least he wouldn't run over that cyclist. so how did you implement it? like, did you just use cameras? and, yeah, programmed with the, the system so that if it sees images, it slows down? and how much time do you give? is the person who's in control of it allowed to program how fast it goes? yes, yeah, you can program it to be more or less like more conservative, like more aggressive driver, um, and you can say what speed you want it to what. what speed is? okay, i know you have ludicrous mode. do you have douchebag mode? well, it just cuts people off. well, for lane changes, it's tricky because if you're in like la like, unless you're pretty aggressive- right, it's pretty- it's hard to change lanes, it's hard to be sat nam, it's hard to be namaste out here in la, yeah, you get, if you want to hit that santa monica boulevard off-ramp. i mean you got to be a little pushy, you got to be a little pushy. yeah, especially angry. yeah, a little angry. they don't want you in, they speed up sometimes. you know, i think people like overall are pretty nice on the highway, even in la, but sometimes they're not. do you think the neural link will help that? probably everybody be locked in together. this hive mind tunnels will help. it won't have traffic. that'll help a lot. yeah, how many of those can you put in there? because, thinking about traveling, buddy, nice thing about tunnels is you can go 3d, so you can go many levels, right, so until you hit hell, yeah, but you could go. you could have a hundred levels of tunnel, no bombs. jesus christ, i don't want to be on 99. that'll be the 99th negative 99 floors. whoo. this is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that it's not like roads. the fundamental issue with roads is that you have a 2d transport system and a 3d living and workspace environment. so you got all these tall buildings or concentrated work environments and and then then you want to go into this like 2d transport system which is hugely inefficient- pretty low density because cars are spaced out pretty far and and so that obviously is not going to work. you're going to have traffic guaranteed, but if you can go 3d on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic. you can either go 3d up with a flying car or go 3d down with tunnels. you can have as many tunnel levels as you want and you can arbitrarily relieve any amount of traffic. you can go further down with tunnels than you can go up with buildings. you're ten thousand feet down if you want. i wouldn't recommend it. but what was that movie with? uh, what's his face? bradley coote, not bradley cooper. uh, christian, no, what the [ __ ] his name? who is batman? christian bale, where he? they fought dragons, him and matthew mcconaughey. they went down deep into the earth. how, how, how deep can you go? yeah, it was. it was batman fought dragons. batman, but it was christian rain of fire. rain of fire, okay, ever saw that? no, yeah, earth is a giant ball of lava with a thin crust on the top which we think of as like the surface, this thin crust, and it's mostly just a big bowl of lava. that's earth, but ten thousand feet's not a big deal. have you given any consideration whatsoever to the flat earth movement? i think that's a troll situation. oh, it's not. no, it's not. you would like to think that because you're a super genius, but i, as a normal, normal person, i know there's people way dumber than me and they really, really believe. they watch youtube videos which go on uninterrupted and spew out a bunch of [ __ ] fake facts very eloquently and articulately, and they really believe. these people really believe. i mean, if it works for them, sure, fine, fine. it's weird, though, right, that this age where you know there's ludicrous mode in your car goes 1.9 seconds, 0 to 60.. 2.2, 2.2, which one's? 1.9? the road, the next generation roadster? okay, standard edition, yeah, i'm on top of this [ __ ]. that's just, that's. that's what the standard edition. yeah, so it's about the performance package. what performance package? yeah, what? what the [ __ ]? do you need to put rocket thrusters on it for real? yes, what are they to burn? nothing, uh, high, ultra high pressure, compressed air- whoa, just call gas thrusters. do you have to have air tanks or they just suck in the air out of? okay, yeah, i just have electric pump. whoa, pump it up to like ten thousand psi. and how fast are we talking? zero to sixteen? how fast you wanna go? i'm so, i'm gonna go. we could make it just fly. i wanna go back in time. make it fly, you make it fly, sure. do you anticipate that as being? i mean, you were talking about the tunnels and then flying cars. do you really think that's going to be real? too noisy and there's too much air flow? so the fundamental issue with flying cars: i mean, if you get like one of those like toy drones, think of how much, how loud those are and how much air that they, how much air they blow. now imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier. this is not going to be make your neighbors happy. your neighbors are not going to be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard it will be very helicopters, helicopter- or on your roof. they're just really going to be like what the hell? that was annoying. yeah, you can't even like: if you want a flying car, just put some wheels on a helicopter. is there a way around that? like what if they figure out some sort of magnetic technology, like all those bob lazar type characters were thinking that was a part of the ufo technology, they were doing it, area 51, remember. didn't they have some, some thoughts about magnetics? nope, no, [ __ ]. yes, really. yeah, there's a fundamental momentum exchange with the air. so you must, uh, you, you must accelerate, you, there's, there's like there's, there's a certain. you have a mass and you have gravity, gravitational acceleration and mass mass times, your mass times. gravity must equal the mass of airflow times, the acceleration of that air flow, to have a neutral force. so it's impossible and then you won't move. but if, okay, if mg is greater than m a, you will go down, and if ma is greater than mg, you will go up. that's how it works. there's just no way around that. there is definitely no way around it. there's no way to create some sort of a magnetic something or another that allows you to. technically, yes, you, you could have a strong enough magnet, but that magnet would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble. we just suck cars up into your car, just pick up. i mean, you'd have to rappel off of either material on the ground or in a really nutty situation off of earth's gravitational field and somehow make that incredibly light, but that magnet would cause so much destruction you'd be better off with a helicopter. so if there was some sort of magnet road- like you have two magnets and they repel each other- if you had some sort of a magnet road that was below you and you could travel on that magnet road, that would work. hahaha, yes, yes, you could have a magnet road. a magnet road- is that too ridiculous? no, it would work. so you could do that. ridiculous too. right, i would not recommend it. there's a lot of things i don't recommend. i would super not recommend that. not good, not wise, i think. no, roads, no, no, that. no, definitely, not. definitely. it was good. that would cause a lot of trouble. so you've put some time and consideration into this, other than- uh, you know, instead of like my foolishly rendered thoughts, so you think that tunnels are the way to do it. oh, it'll work, for sure that'll work. yes, and your, these, these tunnels that you're building right now, these are basically just like test versions of this ultimate idea that you have. you know, it's just a hole in the ground, right, we played videos of it, where you just your idea is that you're going to drop that hole in the ground, there's a sled on it and the sled goes very fast, like 100 miles an hour plus. yeah, you can go real fast, you know, fast as you want. and then, if you want to go long distances, you can just draw the air out of the tunnel. make sure it's real straight, draw the air out of the tunnel. yeah, it's a vacuum tunnel, um, because the then and then, depending on how fast you want to go, you need these wheels, or you could use air bearings, depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel, or you could mag levitt if you want to go super fast. um, so magnet road, yes, but underground. magnet roads, underground, manual, otherwise you're going to really create a lot of trouble with, because there's metal things, ah, so magnet road's the way to go, just underground, if you want to go really fast. underground you would be in you would be: maglev in a vacuum tunnel, mag in a vacuum tunnel, magnetic levitation in a vacuum tunnel, one with rocket launchers. no, i would not recommend putting any exhaust gas in the tunnel. oh, okay, i see what you're saying. you're going to pump it out. right, you'll have to pump it out and you probably have a limited amount of air in the first place. like, how much can you breathe? do you have to pump oxygen into these cubicles? you'd have a pressurized pot to be like like a little tiny underground spaceship, basically like an airplane, because you have air in the airplane. it's not getting new air in, it is, it is. yes, they have like a little hole. yeah, they have a pump really, yeah, it gets it from the outside. yes, wow, i didn't know that. it's like it's the air is airplanes. have it, have it easy, because they essentially, you can, they're pretty leaky, uh, but, jesus, yeah, so long as they, as long as the air pump is working at a decent speed, they have backup pumps. oh, still have, like you know, three pumps or four pumps or something, and uh, and then that then there's like there's an ex. it exhausts through the outflow valve and and through whatever seals are not sealing quite right. usually the door doesn't seal quite right on a plane. this is a bit of leakage around the door and uh and. but the pumps, uh, exceed the outflow rate and then that sets the pressure in the in the cabin. now, have you ever looked at planes and gone? i could fix this, i just don't have time. how does it make it design for a plane? you do, yes, a better design, i mean, probably. i think it is yes, who have you talked to about this? and i've talked to friends, friends, friends, and i'm your friend, girlfriends. you can tell me what do you got? what's going on? well, i mean, the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeover landing, supersonic jet of some kind of vertical takeoff and let it be no need for a runway, just shoot up straight in the air. and then how would you do that? when they do that and some military aircrafts, correct, yes, the trick is that you have, you have to transition to level flight, um, and then you the the. the thing that you'd use for vertical tail for takeover landing is not suitable for high-speed flight, so you have two different systems. i thought about this quite a lot. i've thought about the screen quite a lot. the interesting thing about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack, um, because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. once you've overcome gravitational potential energy and you're at at a high altitude, the energy you use in cruise is very low, and then you can recapture a large part of your, the gravitational potential energy, on the way down. so you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the, the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. this is a lot of energy. so so once you can get high at high, you the, the like. the way to think about a plane is it's a force balance. so the force balance. so a plane that is not accelerating, um, is a neutral force balance. yeah, the force of gravity. you have the lift force of the wings, then you've got the force of the- whatever thrusting device, the, the propeller or turbine or whatever it is, and you've got the resistance force of the air. now, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is. air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square. an exponential beats a square. the higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy. at a certain altitude you will. you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35 000 feet, because it's just a force balance. i'm too stupid for this conversation. it makes sense, though no, i'm sure it does now, when you think about this new idea of of, of designing it. i mean when, when you have this idea about improving planes, are you going to bring this to somebody or you just chuck? i have a lot on my plate, right. that's what i'm saying. i don't know. i don't know how you do what you do now, but if you keep coming up with these- but it's got to be hard to pawn these off on someone else either- hey, go do a job, good job with this vertical take off and landing system that i want to implement to regular planes. the airplane- electric airplane isn't necessary right now. electric cars are important, solar energy is important, stationary storage of energy is important. these things are much more important than creating electric supersonic fetal. also, the planes. naturally, you really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft and this is improving over time. so you know it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. that's why electric cars- it matters whether electric cars happen sooner or later. you know we're really playing the crazy game here with the atmosphere and the oceans. we're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this, putting this knee, in the atmosphere. this is crazy. we should not do this. it's very dangerous. so we should. we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. i mean this. the bizarre thing is that obviously we're going to run out of oil in the long term. you know we're gonna. there's only so much oil we can. we can mine and burn. it's total logical. we must have such a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term. so we know that's the end point. we know that. so why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans? this is an insane experiment. it's the dumbest experiment in in human history. why are we doing this? it's crazy. do you think this is a product of momentum, that we started off doing this when it was just a few engines, a few 100 million gallons of fuel over the whole world- not that big of a deal- and then, slowly but surely, over a century, it got out of control. and now it- it's not just our fuel, but it's also- i mean, fossil fuels are involved in so many different electronics, so many different items that people buy. there's just this constant desire for fossil fuels, constant need for oil, without consideration of the sustainability, the things like oil, oil, coal, gas. it's the easy money, right, it's easy money. so have you heard about clean coal the president's been tweeting about? it's got to be real clean coal. all caps, did you see? he used all caps, clean coal. um, well, you know, it's very difficult to put that co2 back in the ground. it doesn't like being in solid form. it takes a lot of energy. like that, like some sort of a filter, giant building sized filter, sucks carbon out of the atmosphere. no, no, it doesn't, it's not possible. no, no, no, no, definitely in [ __ ]. no, we're not [ __ ]. i mean, this is quite a complex question, right, you know, we're really just when we're. the more carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere and and a lot of it gets permeated into the oceans- the more dangerous it is. like i, i don't think right now, i think we're okay right now. we can probably even add some more, but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow, like the. there's a vast base of industry, vast transportation system like this. there's two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world. so and and the the new car and truck production, if it was a hundred percent electric, that's only about a hundred million per year. so it would take. if you could snap your fingers and instantly turn all old cars and trucks electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric makes sense, because how long does a truck, car, truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed? about 20 to 25 years. is there a way to accelerate that process, like some sort of subsidies or some encouragement from the government financially? well, the thing that is going on right now is that there's a, an inherent subsidy in any oil burning device. any, any power plant or car is fundamentally, uh, consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just say atmosphere for short. so, like you can say, okay, there's a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere, and so there's some uncertain number where, if we put too much carbon in the atmosphere. things overheat, oceans warm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, something's underwater and and, but it's not clear what that number is, but it's definitely a scientist with all. it's really quite. the scientific, scientific consensus is overwhelming, um, overwhelming. i mean. i don't know any serious scientists, actually zero, literally zero. who who don't think that you know that that we were have quite a serious climate risk that we're facing, and so there's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing: power plants, aircraft, car, frankly, even rockets. i mean rockets use up, you know, they burn, they burn fuel. but there's just, you know, with rockets there's just no other way to to get to orbit, unfortunately, so it's the only way. but with cars, there's definitely a better way with electric cars. and to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics, because we've got a giant thermonuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. it's great, it shows up every day, very reliable. so if you can generate energy from solar panels stored with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day, um, and then you can, you know, concentrate to the poles or near to the north, uh, with, uh, you know, high voltage lines, also the north, northern part parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. but anyway, all fossil fuel powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans. so people tend to think like: why, why should electric vehicles have a subsidy? but they're not taking into account that all fossil fuel burning vehicles, fundamentally, are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to earth. but nobody's paying for it. we are going to pay for it. obviously in the future we will pay for it. it's just not paid for now. now, what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars and trucks and things like that? is it battery capacity? yeah, i've got to scale up production, got to make the car compelling, make it better than gasoline or diesel cars, make it more efficient in terms of, like, the distance it can travel. yeah, you're going to be able to go far, far enough, recharge fast and your roadster you're. you're anticipating 600 miles. is that correct? yeah, yeah, what is it 600 miles? is that right now, like, have you driven one 600 miles now? no, we could totally make one right now. that would do 600 miles, but the thing is too expensive. so it's like the car much more so. well, you know, just have a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack and you can go 600 miles. what do you have now? 330 mile range. so that's really 30 miles. what is that in terms of kilowatts? well, that would be for a model s. 100 kilowatt hour pack will do about 330 miles, maybe 335, but some people have hypermiled it to 500 miles, hyper mild it would. yeah, i just like go on 45 miles an hour or something. yeah, they're like 30 miles an hour or something. it's like on level ground with you pump the tires up really well and go on a smooth surface and and you can go for a long time. um, but do you like definitely comfortably do 300 miles is fine for most people? uh, usually 200 or 250 miles is fine. 300 miles is you don't even think about it really. is there any possibility that you could use solar power, that solar powered, one day, especially in los angeles? i mean, as you said, about that giant nuclear reactor a million times bigger than earth just floating in the sky. is it possible that one day you'll be able to just power all these cars just on solar power? i mean, we don't ever have cloudy days. if we do? there's three of them. well, the surface area of a car is, without making the car like really blocky, um, or having some like a g wagon, yeah, like, and just like having like a lot of surfs area where, like, maybe like solar panels fold out or something like your e-class, that's what we needed. uh, the e-type- yeah, that, the e-jaguar e-type with a giant long hood that could be a giant solar panel. well, at the beginning of tesla, i did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing that you'd press a button and it would just like unfold these solar panels and like charge, recharge your car in the parking lot. ah, yeah, we could do that, but i think it's probably better to just put that on your roof right and yeah, and then it's going to just be facing the sun all the time because, like what car? otherwise, your car could be in the shade. you know, covering the shade in a garage or something like that. yeah, didn't a fisker have that on the roof? the fiskar karma new generation, for i believe it was only for the the radio, is that correct? yeah, i mean, i think it could like recharge like two miles a day or something. did you laugh when they started blowing up when they got hit with water. do you remember what happened? they got the. what? yeah they, when they had a, a dealership, or, oh, yeah, the fisker karmas were parked. was that like that with a flood in jersey? yes, yes, when the the hurricane came in, they got overwhelmed with water and they all started exploding. this [ __ ] great video of it. did you watch the video? i, i didn't watch the video, but i didn't see that picture of the ass being naked, lubed up, watched that video, laughed my ass off. they all blow up. they got wet and they blew up. that's not good. yeah, we made our battery waterproof, so that doesn't happen. smart move. yeah, there's a guy in kazakhstan that, um, i think it was kazakhstan that he. he just boated through a tunnel under an underwater tunnel, like a flooded tunnel, and just turn the wheels to steer and press the accelerator and it just floated through the tunnel and he's, wow, steered around the other cars. you're like that's amazing. it's on the internet what happens if your car gets a little sideways, like if you're driving in snow. like what if you're driving if your auto pilot is on and you're in like denver and it snows out and your car gets a little sideways, does it correct itself? oh yeah, it's got great traction control, but does it know how to like correct? do you know how? like? oh yeah, your ass end kicks out? you know how to counter steer? oh yeah, no, it's really good it knows how to do it. yeah, wow, it's pretty crazy. that's pretty crazy. yeah, so, like, if you're going sideways, it knows how to correct itself. it generally won't go sideways. it won't. no, why not? it will correct itself before it goes sideways, even in black eyes. yeah, this video is where you could see the car be. uh, try it alone. traction control system is very good. it makes you feel like superman. it's great. you like. you feel like you can like this. it will make you feel like this incredible driver. i believe it. yeah, now how do you program? we do our testing on like an ice lake in sweden- oh, really yeah. and like norway and canada and a few other places. porsha does a lot of that too. new zealand as well. they do a lot of their. they do some of their driver training school on these frozen surfaces. so you're just you. the car's going sideways whether you like it or not, and you have to learn how to slide into corners and how to adjust. well, electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast, right? so with the gasoline car you've got a lot of latency. uh, it takes a while for the and the engine to react and for the, you know, but for elec, electric motors, incredibly precise. um, that's why you, like, you can imagine, like, like, if you had, like a printer or something, uh, you would, only you wouldn't have a gasoline engine printer, that would be pretty weird. um, or, or, like a surgical device, it's gonna be an electric motor on the surgical device, on the printer, gasoline engine's gonna be just chugging away, it's not going to have the reaction time, but to an electric motor, it's operating at the millisecond level so it can turn on track, on and off traction within like inches of getting on the honest like, let's say, drive a patch of ice, it'll turn traction off and then turn it on a couple inches right after the ice, like it's a little patch of ice, because in in the frame of the electric motor, you're moving incredibly slowly. you're like a snake, it's, you're a snail, you're just moving so slowly because it's it's it can see at a thousand frames a second and so it's say one mississippi it. it just thought about at things a thousand times so it's realized that your wheels are not getting traction. it understands there's some slippery surface that you're driving on, yes, and it makes adjustments in real time. yes, in milliseconds that would. that would be so much safer than a regular car. yes, it is just that alone for loved ones you'd, you'd want them to be driving your car. yes, i'm on dude board. regular motors- the, the s, x and three- are have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the us government. wow, this is yeah, but it's pretty funny. it's pretty crazy. like we, you know, people- still sue us like they'll have like some accident at 60 miles an hour where they'd like twisted an ankle and they sleep. they like they'll be dead in another car. they still sue us. but that's to be expected. it is to be expected. do you take that into account with like the same sort of fatalistic, uh you know undertones? just sort of just go. uh, you gotta just let it go. this is what people do tell you. i've got it. that's what it is. quite a lot of respect for the justice system. judges are very smart and they see they've like i haven't. so far i've found judges to be very good at justice because i like, like, what like, and juries are good too, like they're actually quite good. um, you know people you know you read about, like, occasional errors in the justice system. let me tell you, most the time they're very good. um, and like you know the guy i mentioned that who fell asleep in the car and he, he rode over a cyclist and you know, and- and that was what encouraged me to get autopilot out as soon as possible- that guy sued us. he sued you for falling asleep. yes, he, i i'm not kidding, he blames it on the new car. smell what? yes, he blamed him falling asleep on your new car. smell. there's someone, there's a lawyer. this is a real thing. somewhere there's a lawyer that thought that through in front of his laptop before he wrote that up. yes, he got a lawyer and he sued us and the judge was like you're, this is crazy, stop bothering me. no, thank god. yes, thank god, thank god, there's a judge out there with a brain. i'll tell you, judges are judges are very good some of them. what about that judgment? a lot of boys up up the river in pennsylvania who is selling those kids out. you know about that story. yeah, judge was selling young boys to prisons. he was like literally, yeah, literally, under bribes, for he was. was this an elected judge? or he was like somebody said, you have a judge, that's like actually a politician. no, he's elected judge. this is a very famous story. who? he's in jail right now? i think for the rest of his life. and he put away. he, he would take like a young boy, would do something like steal something from a store, and he would put him in detention for you know, five years- something ridiculously egregious. and they investigated his history and they found out that he was literally being paid off. um, was it by private prisons? is that what the the deal was? there was some sort of uh, but anyway, this judges, two judges, two judges, kids for cash scandal is what it's called 2008. yeah, um, common, please, judges. so i think they are elected. and who is paying them? oh, um, someone. it was proven to the point where they're in jail now that someone was paying them to uh, put more asses in the seats in these private prisons. a million dollar payment to put him in the youth centers builder. a million dollar payment. yeah, i do think it's. this private prisons thing is creating a bad incentive, right? yes, um, but i mean that judge is in prison. um, thank god, yes, but i? i for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that, i want to assure you this is not the case. the vast majority of judges are very good, i agree, and they care about justice, and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer and instead they cared about justice and they made less money because they care about justice and that's why they're judges. i feel that same way about police officers. i feel like there's so many interactions with so many different people with police officers that the very few that stand out that are horrific. we, we tend to look at that like: this is evidence that police are all corrupt, and i think that's crazy. no, most, most police are- are- are very honest. yes, um, and uh, and and and and. like the military evidence, military personnel that i know are very honorable, ethical people, yes, and much more ethical than the average person. that's my impression. that's my impression as well, but- and that's not to suggest that we be complacent and assume everyone's honest and ethical, and obviously, if somebody is is given a a trusted place in society, such as being a police officer or a judge, and they are corrupt, then we must be extra vigilant against such situations. yes, and take action, uh, but but we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession. i couldn't agree more. i think there's also an issue with um. one of the things that happens with police officers, prosecutors and and anyone that's trying to convict someone or arrest someone, is that it becomes a game, and in games people want to win and sometimes people cheat. yes, yes, i mean, if you know, if you're a prosecutor, you should not always want to win. there are times when you should like, okay, i just should not want to win this case, um, and then you know like, just pass on that case. sometimes people want to win too much. that is true, um, i think also the it becomes tough if you're, if you're, like a district attorney. you know you, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals and then your, your view of the world can get negatively. yes, you know, have a negative. you know you have a negative view of the world because you know you're just interacting with a lot of criminals. but actually most of society is not consistent criminals, right? um, and i actually had this conversation at dinner several years ago with district attorney. i was like man, it must sometimes seem pretty, pretty dark because, you know, man, there's some, some terrible human beings out there. and he was like yep, and he was like dealing with some case which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money. it was rough. i was like wow, that's, that's, that's pretty rough. it's like it's like hard to maintain faith in humanity if you're a district attorney. but but you know it's only a few percent of society that are actually bad. and then if you go to the worst- say point one percent of society, or the worst, one in a thousand, one in a million- you know like how bad is the millionth worst person in the united states? pretty damn bad, like damn evil, like the, the millionth, like the millionth. well, one in a million of evil is so evil people cannot even conceive of it. but there's 330 million people in the united states. so that's 330 people out there somewhere. but by the same token, there's also 330 people who are incredible angels and unbelievably good human beings, yeah, on the other side. but because of our fear of danger, we tend to, our thoughts tend to gravitate towards the worst case scenario. yes, and we want to frame that, and it's one of the real problems with prejudice. we want- whether it's prejudice towards different minorities or prejudice towards police officers or anything it's like- we want to look at the worst case scenario and say: this is an example of what this is all about. and you see that, even with people, how they frame genders- some- some men frame women like that- they get ripped off by a few women and they decide: all women are evil. some women get [ __ ] over by a few men, all men are [ __ ] and- and this, this is very toxic and it's also it's a very unbalanced way of viewing the world and it's very emotionally based and it's based on your own experience, your own anecdotal experience, and it can, it can be very influential to the people around you. and it's just, it's a dangerous way, it's a dangerous thought process and pattern to promote. it is. it is a very dangerous pattern. i really think you know, people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they're good until proven otherwise, and i think really most people are actually pretty good people. nobody's perfect. they have to be, if you think of the vast numbers of us that are just interacting with each other, with each other constantly. yeah, we have to be better than we think we are. yeah, there's no way, like there's no other way. i mean hear all these weapons like: but how many times like nobody's presumably trying to murder you and you're nobody. yes, nobody's like putting: that's right, it's right there. fake flamethrower here, it's not not a flamethrower. now we got a real problem. i'm gonna put it on that side too. i'm gonna leave it for the guests. yeah, i'm like: look man, if i say something that [ __ ] up, it's right there. so we'll liven things up. for sure, it's guaranteed to make any party better. yeah, well, that's i mean, that's the armed uh civilization theory, right, that a an armed uh community is a safe and polite community. yeah, texas, it's kind of true. yeah, i mean, people in texas are super polite and everyone's got a gun. yes, don't make somebody angry. yeah, i don't know. don't know what's going to happen. yeah, it's not a good move. yeah, piss people off when everybody can have a gun. yeah, off to just let that guy get in your lane. yeah, yeah, uh, you know we got a big uh test site in central texas near waco, oh, beautiful. yeah, spacex, uh, in mcgregor, um, it's about 15 minutes away from wake up. that's close to where ted nugent lives. shout out to ted nugent: okay, cool, yeah, um, yeah, they're. you know we have luck, lots of fire and loud explosions and things and people like that. they're cool with it. they don't give a [ __ ] out there. they're very supportive. yeah, that you can buy fireworks where you know your kids go to school? yeah, it's. you know it's dangerous. yeah, but it's free, it's free. there's something about texas that's very enticing because of that. it is dangerous, but it's also free, right, yeah, yeah, i kind of like texas actually. well, i prefer it over places that are more restrictive but more liberal, because you could always be liberal, like, just because things are free and just because you have a certain amount of, you know, right wing type characters, it doesn't mean you have to be that way, you know, and and honestly, there's a lot of those people that are pretty [ __ ] open-minded and let you do whatever you want to do, right, you don't bother them. yeah, exactly that's my hope right now with um. the way we're able to communicate with each other today, and how radically different it is than generations past, is that we all just the dust settles and we all realize, like, like what you were saying- that most people are good. most people are good, the vast majority. yes, i think you should give people the benefit of that for sure. i think you're right. yeah, you know who can help that. what mushrooms don't you think they're delicious? yeah, right, yeah, they're good for you too. yeah, all of them, all kinds of them. um, what do you see in terms of like when you think about the future of your companies? what do you see as like bottlenecks? you want some more of those. uh, sure, thank you. what do you see in terms of like bottlenecks of things that are that are holding back innovation? is it regulatory commissions and and people that don't understand the technology that are influencing policy? like, what, what? what could potentially be holding you guys back right now? is there anything that you would change? yeah, that's a good question. you know, i wish, i wish politicians were better at science. that would help a lot. that's a problem. yes, there's no incentive for them to be good at science. there isn't? um, actually, you know they're pretty good at science in china, i have to say, yeah, the mayor of beijing is, i believe, in environmental engineering degree and the deputy mayor as a physics degree. i met them and uh, mayor shanghai is really smart and you're up on technology. what do you think about this government policy of of stopping use of huawei phones? and there's, there's something about the the, the worry about spying is. i mean, from what i've understand from real tech people, they think it's horseshit. oh, i like phones. i don't know, i don't know. um, like the government say, don't you buy huawei phones? does that do? are you up on that at all? no, should we just abandon this idea? well, i think, like, i guess, if you're, if you're, uh, if you have like top secret stuff, um, then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use, uh, but you know, like most people do not have top secret stuff, right, and like nobody really cares what porn you watch, you know, right, like it's like nobody actually cares, you know so, and if they do, that's kind of on them like national spy agencies do not care, do not give a rat's ass what porn you watch. they do not care. so like what secrets does a national spy agency have to learn from the average citizen? nothing, well, that's the argument against the. the narrative and the argument by a lot of these tech people is that the real concern is that these companies like huawei are innovating at a radical pace and they're trying to stop them from integrating into our culture and letting this like right now. they're the number two cell phone manufacturer in the world. okay, samsung's number one, huawei is number two, apple is now number three. they surpassed apple's number two, and the idea is that this is all taking place without them having any foothold whatsoever in america. there are no, there's no carriers that have their phones. you have to buy their phones unlocked through some sort of a third party and then put it. okay. so and the the worry is: you know that these are somehow another controlled by the chinese government. the communist chinese government is going to distribute these phones and i don't know if it's the worries economic influence that they'll have too much power. i don't know what it is. are you? are you paying attention on any of this? not really, you know. i don't think we should worry too much about huawei phones. uh, you know, maybe you know our national security agencies shouldn't have huawei phones. maybe that's a question mark, uh, but uh, i think for the average citizen it doesn't matter, doesn't? doesn't like no, they're not. i'm pretty sure the chinese government does not care about the goings-on of the average american citizen. is there, is there a time where you think that there will be no security, will be impossible to hold back information, that whatever bottleneck we'll, we'll let go, we're gonna, we're gonna give in. that whatever bottleneck between privacy and ultimate innovation will have to be bridged in order for us to achieve the next level of technological proficiency, that we're just going to abandon it and there'll be no, no security, no privacy. do people want privacy because they seem to put everything on the internet? well, right now they're confused. but when you're talking about your neural link and this, this idea that one day we are going to be able to share information, we're going to be some sort of a thing that's symbiotically create, uh, symbiotically connected, yeah, i think we really need to worry about security in that situation and for sure, that's like a security paramount, sure, yeah. but also what we will be is will be so much different. our concerns about money, about status, about, well, all these things will seemingly go by the wayside if we really become enlightened, if we really become artificially enlightened by some sort of an ai interface where we have this symbiotic relationship with some new internet type connection to information. what you know, what happens then? what? what is important, what is not important? is privacy important, when we're all gods? i mean, i think the things that we think are important to keep private right now, right, we probably will not think are shame, right, information, right, what do you, what do you hide emotions, what are we hiding? i mean, i think, like i don't know, maybe it's like embarrassing stuff, right, embarrassing stuff. but there's actually, like, i think people there's like not that much that's kept private, that people that is actually relevant, right, that's people, what other people actually care about, and we think other people care about it, but they don't really care about it, and certainly governments don't. well, some people care about it, but then it gets weird when you, when it gets exposed. like jennifer lawrence, when those naked pictures of her got exposed, like i think in some ways people liked her more. they realized like she's just a person, just a girl who likes sex and is just alive and has a boyfriend and sends them messages. and now you get to look into it- and you probably shouldn't of- but somebody let it go and they put it online and, all right, she seems to be doing okay. she's a person, she's just you and me and it's the same thing. she's just in some weird place where she's on a 35 foot tall screen with music playing. every time she talks: yeah, i, i, i. i mean i'm sure she's like not, she's not happy about it, but she's. but she's clearly doing fine. but once this interface is fully realized, where we really do become something far more powerful in terms of our cognitive ability or our ability to understand irrational thoughts and and mitigate them, and that we're all connected in some sort of an insane way- what i mean? how, what? our thoughts on wealth, our thoughts on social status- like how many of those just evaporate- and our need for privacy, maybe our need for privacy will be the ultimate bottleneck that we'll have to substitute, that we'll have to surpass. i think the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future, but there will be things that are important. what would be more different things. i know there might be some more of ideas potentially. i don't think darwin's going away, right? no one's going to be there. no one dawn will be there forever, forever. yeah, it would just be a different, a different arena, different arena, a digital arena, different arena. darwin's not going away. what keeps you up at night? well, it's quite hard to run companies, yeah, especially car companies. i have to say it's quite challenging. the car business is the hardest one of all the things you do. yes, because it's a consumer-oriented business, as opposed to like spacex, and not that spacex, spacex, there's no walk in the park, but but a car company. it's very difficult to keep a car company alive. it's very difficult. you know, there's only two car companies in the history of american car companies that haven't gone bankrupt, and that's ford and tesla. that's it. yeah, ford rode out that crazy storm. huh, they're the only ones, the skin of their teeth, shout out to the mustang. yeah, yeah, by the skin of their teeth. that is interesting, right. same with tesla. we barely survived. how close did you get to folding? very close, we. uh, for 2008 is not a good time to be a car company, especially a startup car company, and especially an electric car company. that was like stupidity squared. and this is when you had those cool roadsters with the t-top- yeah, with the um target top- yeah. we had like, uh, he was a highly modified elise chassis. the body was all completely different. by the way, that was a super dumb strategy. that we actually did was dumb. it was based on two false premises. uh, one false premise was that we'd be able to cheaply convert the lotus elise and use that as a car platform and that we would be able to use technology from this little company called ac propulsion for the electric drivetrain and the battery. problem is the ac propulsion technology did not work in production and we ended up using none of it in the long term. none of it. we had to redesign everything. and then the- once you add a battery pack, an electric motor, to the car, it got heavier, got 30 heavier, invalidated the entire structure, all the crash structure. everything had to be redone. nothing like i think it had. less than seven percent of the parts were common with any other device, including cars or anything. that's the seven percent. yes, everything, including tires and wheels, bolts, brakes, yeah, even the steering wheel. see, the steering wheel was. i think the steering wheel was almost the same. yes, the, the windscreen when it's different? no, i think the windscreen is the same same. yes, i think i think we were able to keep this last seven percent, so that's right. basically, every body panel is different. the entire structure was different. the? uh, we couldn't use the h like the hvac system, the, you know, the air conditioner was a belt-driven air conditioner. so now we needed, uh, something that was electrically driven. we need a new ac compressor and all that takes away from the battery life as well. right, yeah, we needed a small, highly efficient air conditioning system, um, that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powered, not belt driven. it was very difficult. how much did those weigh, the, those cars? the roadster, i think it was about twenty seven hundred pounds. that's still very sound, depending on which version: twenty six, fifty to twenty seven, fifty pounds, something like that. and what was the weight distribution? um, it was about fifty. well, there were different versions of the car, um, so it was about 55 on the rear, because it was rear biased, right, but not bad. like considering, like a 911, which is like one of the most popular sports cars of all time, heavy rear end bias. well, i mean, yeah, the 911. i think the joke is like they managed to despite newton not being on their side. yeah, if you're fighting newton, it's very difficult. well, it's like you've got those. the moments of inertia on a 911 don't make any sense. they do once you understand them. once you understand you don't want to hang the engine off the ass. this is not a wise move. you don't want to let up on the gas when you're in a corner. the problem with whether with with something- that's where the engine is mounted- over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear, is that your moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed. you cannot solve this, it's unsolvable. you're screwed. you're screwed right, like, essentially, if you spawn the car like a top. that's your problem. moment of inertia you're just. i promised i wouldn't swear on this show. by the way, really, to who? because it was my friend. tell that friend to go [ __ ] himself. who told you not to swear? afraid i'm not a good friend. yes, definitely realize you're [ __ ]. elon musk. you can do whatever you want. man, if you ever get confused, call me, i'll swear in private. swear up a storm. just say fricken. it's a fun way there's like old house moms, [Laughter] wives and [ __ ] that have children. oh, this freaking thing, yeah, but anyway, like, like the porsche is kind of incredible. how well porsche handle is, given that, uh, it's the physics, yes, the moments of inertia are so messed up, uh, to actually still make it work well is is incredible. well, if you know how to turn into the corner, once you get used to the feeling of it, there's actual benefits to it. you know there are some benefits i enjoy. i, the car i had before tesla, was a 911. oh, okay, that was 997 or six. yeah, 997, yeah, yeah, um, great car man, yeah, i mean particularly with on the porsche, when they had the variable vanes, uh, the turbo, and you didn't have the turbo lag. that was great, yeah, that was really great. the turbo lag was is like, you know, if you floor it, like phone home, call your mom, the older one, about an hour later the car accelerates, and super dangerous too, because then the real wheels start spinning. yeah, yeah, there's something fun about it, though, like feeling that rear weight kicking around, you know, and again, it's quite efficient, a good feel to it, yeah, yeah, i agree, but that's that's what i was talking about earlier, about that little car that i have, the 93 911. it's just there's. it's not fast, it's not, it's not the best handling car, but it's more satisfying than any other car i have because it's so mechanical. it's like everything about it, like crackles and bumps, and it gives you all this feedback. and i take it to the comedy store because when i get there i feel like my brain is just popping and it's on fire. it's like a strategy for me. now that i i really stopped driving other cars there, i drive that car there just for the brain juice, just for the, the, the inner, the interaction. i mean you should try model s p 100 d. i'll try to blow your mind, your skull, okay, yeah, tell me what to order, i'll order it. model sp 100d. okay, jamie, that's the best car that i drive. okay, okay, i'll get with the car you drive. okay, it will blow your mind out of your scope. i believe you. how far can i drive? how far? about 300 miles? that's good for la regular days. you will never notice the battery, never, never. how hard is it to get like one of them crazy plugs installed in your house? that difficult? no, it's super easy. it's like, yeah, it's like a dryer plug, it's like a dryer outlet. didn't you come up with some crazy tiles for your roof that are solar paneled? yeah, yeah, we're. i have it on my roof right now- actually, i'm just trying it out. it's like it's the thing. it takes a while to like test roof stuff because roofs have to last a long time, right? so, like, you want your roof to last like 30 years over a regular groove now. so there's two versions. there's like the solar panels you put on a roof, so, like, depending on whether your roof's new or old. so if your roof's new, you don't want to replace the roof. you want to put, like, solar panels on the roof, right, um, so that's like retrofit, you know? and then we're trying to make the retrofit panels look real nice, um, and then. but then the new product we're coming out with is, if you, if you have a roof- that's either you're building a house or you're gonna replace your roof anyway- then you make the site, the tiles have solar solar cells embedded in the tiles, and then it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the, like the glass tile, uh, so you have to really work with, like the glass, and, and the various coatings and layers so that you don't see the solar cell behind the glass. otherwise it doesn't look right, right, so it's really tricky. there it is, jamie, put it up there, yeah, and that looks good. see, is there a? uh see, like, if you look closely you can see. if you're zooming like, you can see the, so you can see the cell, but if you zoom out, you don't see the cell. right, well, it looks cool, though like that's, that's hard visible. it's really hard because you have to have sunlight go through, right, but where to cut when this, when it gets reflected back out, it doesn't it? it hides the fact that there's a cell there now. are those available to the consumer right now? well, we have, uh, i think, those on that roof right there. yes, that's amazing. oh, that looks good. yeah, oh, i like that. that one's hard. oh, so you got that kind of fake spanish looking thing. i like that. that's french slate. that's white people in connecticut smoking pipes. look at that one. yeah, that's badass dude. so those all actually work, i believe you. so the, the, the, the solar panels that are on that house that we just looked at, is that sufficient to power the entire home? it depends on your energy, on how, yeah, yeah, so, um, generally, yes, i would say it's probably for most. it's going to vary, but anywhere from more than you need to, uh, maybe half, like call it a half to 1.5 of the energy that you need, depending on how much roof you have relative to living space and how ridiculous you are with the tv. tv is no problem. air conditioning, air conditioning- okay, air conditioning is the problem if you have an efficient air conditioner and you don't, and depending on how like are you air conditioning rooms when they don't need to be air conditioned, which is very common because it's a pain in the neck. it's like programming a vcr. it's like, right, you know, it's just the blinking 12 and so people just like hell with that. i'm just going to make it this temperature all day long. right, you don't have a smart home where, if you're in the room, then it stays cool? right, yeah, it should predict when you're going to be home and then cool the room, the rooms that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence. we're not talking about like genius home here. we're just talking like elementary basic stuff. um, you know, like if you could hook that into the car. like it knows you're coming home, like there's no point in cooling the home, keeping the comb, keeping the whole the home really cool when you're not there, right, but it can tell that you're coming home, it's going to cool it to the right temperature, right? you have an app there that works with your solar panels or anything like that. yeah, yeah, we do, and we need to hook it into the air conditioning to really make the air conditioning work. have you thought about creating an air conditioning system? i know you have a trick question: cannot answer questions about future potential. okay, let's just let it go. we'll move on to the next thing. that would be an interesting idea. yeah, i would say radiant heating, all that good ideas. now, when you, when you think about the efficiency of these homes and you think about implementing solar power and battery power, and is there anything else that people are missing? is there any other? like? i just saw a smart watch that is powered by the heat of the human body. it's some new technology. it's able to fully power that way. i don't know if it's fully or if it's like this watch right here. this is a casio, okay, um, it's called a uh pro-tec and it's in like an outdoors watch and it's solar-powered, okay, and so it has the ability to operate for a certain amount of time on solar. yeah, so if you have it exposed, it could function for a certain amount of time on solar. yeah, well, you know, um, like, there's the self-winding watches where you know it's just got a weight in the watch and as you move your wrist, the weight moves from one side to the other and it winds the watch up. that's a pretty cool thing, yeah, yeah, well, it's amazing that like rolex is that it's all done mechanically. there's no batteries in there, there's no nothing. yeah, you could do the same thing: create a little charger that's based on uh wrist movement. it really depends on how much energy your watch uses. you know what's [ __ ] up about that, though we accept a certain amount of like [ __ ] with those watches. like, i brought my watch- i have a rolex that my friend lorenzo gave me and i brought it to, um, the watch store and i said: this thing's always fast. i said it's always like, after a couple months it's like five minutes fast and they go, yep, they go. yeah, really, it's just what it does and i go, hold on, i go. so you're telling me that it just is always going to be fast. it's like, yeah, it's just like every few months you gotta like reset. it seems like they should recalibrate that thing. they can't. they tried. they say every few months, whether it's four months or five months or six months, it's gonna be a couple of minutes fast, okay. it seems like they should really, uh, recalibrate that, because if it's always fast, you can just, you know, delete those minutes. you need to [ __ ] kick down the door at rolex and go. you [ __ ] are lazy. [Laughter]. it's kind of amazing that you can keep tie mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears. it's amazing. yeah, i mean, the the whole luxury watch market is fascinating. i i'm i'm not that involved in in terms, like i don't buy them. i bought them as gifts. i don't buy them for myself. but when i look at them online, like there's million dollar watches out there now that are like they have like little rotating moons and stars and they they live like, look at this thing, how much is that one, jamie, these are [ __ ] preposterous. i like gears, i love them. yeah, i think they're beautiful, but there's some of these people that are just taking it right in the ass. they're buying these watches for like 750 000. i'm like, yo, that's a timex sun. nobody knows. it's not any better than some casio that you could just buy online like, look at that though. well, here's the thing. if you're a person that doesn't just want to know the time, you want craftsmanship, you want some artisans touch, you want innovation in terms of, like, a person figuring out how gears and cogs all line up perfectly to every time it turns over. it's basically a second. i mean, that's just there's. there's art to that. that's it. yeah, it's not just telling time. i like this watch a lot, but if it got hit by a rock i wouldn't be sad. yeah, it's just a watch, it's a. it's a mass-produced thing that runs on some quartz battery, but those things- that's, there's art to that. no, i agree it's beautiful. yeah, yeah, i love it. yeah, there's something, there's something amazing about it. it's because it represents the human creativity. it's not just. it's not just, uh, electronic innovation. there's something, there's, there's a person's work in that. yes, but you don't have a watch on. no, ever i used to have a watch. what happened, mike? my phone tells the time, so good point. what if you lose your phone? do you wait? hold on, true, let me guess you are a no case guy, that's correct. living on the edge, looking on the edge, without a case. tyson, neil degrasse, tyson was in here last week. i i marveled at his ability to get through life without a case, that's right. you know, he takes his phone and he flips it in between his fingers like like a, like a, a a soldier would do with his rifle, right, he just rolls that [ __ ] in between his fingers. okay, marvelous, wow. he says. that's the reason why they do it. he said: will you look at someone who has a rifle? why would they do that? why would they flip it around like that? right, so that when it goes to drop they have it in their hand, they catch it quickly. so that's what he does with his phone. he's just flipping his phone around all the time. i got that in mexico. i was hoping it holds joints. does it do anything? it seems to open. oh, it's just a hole, just a hole. good, storage, storage in there. but like, try to put a joint in there, close it. you put like one, one blunt one, but it seems pretentious. you know, that's the idea behind it. i bought it when i was in mexico because i figured it would be a good size to hold joints restaurant. so is that a joint? or is it a cigar? no, okay, it's um marijuana inside of, uh, tobacco. okay, so it's like posh plot tobacco. you never had that. yeah, i think i tried one once. come on, man, you probably can't because stockholders- right, i mean it's legal. right, it's totally legal. okay, how does that work? do people get upset at you if you do certain things? there's tobacco and marijuana in there, that's all it is the. the combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful. first turned onto it by charlie murphy and then reignited by dave chappelle. there you go, plus whiskey- exactly perfect, balances it out alcohol. alcohol is a drug. it's been grandfathered in. well, it's not just a drug. it's a drug that gets a bad rap because you just have a little, it's great, fine, yeah, a little sip here and there and you just your inhibitions are relaxed and it shows your true self and hopefully you're more joyous and friendly and happy and and everything's good. the real worry is the people that can't handle it like the real worry about people who can't handle cars that can go zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds or anything. have you ever considered something that like? imagine if one day everyone has a car that's on the same, at least technological, standard as one of your cars and everyone agrees that the smart thing to do is not just to have bumpers but to perhaps have some sort of a magnetic repellent device, something some electro magnetic field around the cars that, as cars come close to each other, they automatically radically decelerate because of magnets or something. well, i mean, our cars break automatically break, yeah, yeah, when they see things, yes, but like a physical barrier, like, uh, well, the wheels work pretty well, the wheels do, yeah, yeah, they work pretty well, decelerated that's, you know, 1.1 to 1.2 g's, that kind of thing. is there a concern that one day all your cars will be on the road and then they'll still be regular people with regular cars 20, 30 years from now? that'll get in the mix and be the the main problem. yeah, i think it'd be sort of like it was a time of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars on the road at the same time. it's been pretty weird. oh, that'd be the weirdest. yeah, i mean horses were tricky. you know, back in, uh, manhattan had like 300 000 horses. you figure, like a horse lives 15 years, you've got 20 000 horses dropping dead every day or every year. i should say every year, 20 000 horses. if there's 300 000 horses in 15-year lifespan. back in the gangs in new york days- that movie, yeah, yeah, it's a lot of dead horses and you need a horse to move the horse right and they'll probably get pretty, pretty freaked out if they have to move a dead horse. do you think they know what's going on? yeah, i mean, it's going to be like pretty weird. no, i would imagine, am i dragging this dead? you know horse around and i'm a horse. do you ever stop and think about your role in civilization? do you ever stop and think about your role in the culture? because me, as a person who never met you until today, when i think of you, you know, i've always thought of you as being this weirdo super inventor dude who just somehow or another keeps coming up with new [ __ ]. but there's not a lot of you out there, like everybody else seems to be. i mean, obviously you make a lot of money and there's a lot of people that make a lot of money. you like that clock? yeah, pretty dope. right, this is a great clock. yeah, you want one. i'll get you one. sure, okay, done. i like weird things like this. oh, this is the coolest. it's tgt promotion. what is this? tgt studios? tgt studios? yeah, yeah, um, it's a gentleman who makes all this by hand. yeah, it's really cool. my study is filled with weird devices. well, get ready for another one. all right, i'm sending it your way. cool, you want a werewolf too? i'll hook you up. all right, i'll take one. one werewolf and one clock coming up. do you think about your role in the culture? because me, as a person who never met you until today, i i've always looked at you and like, wow, like how's this guy just keep inventing [ __ ]? like, how do you, how do you keep coming up with all these new devices? and what do you ever consider? how on you? like? i had a dream once that there was a million teslas. instead of, like, one tesla, there was a million teslas. okay, not chesley the car, but nicola. oh yeah, sure, and that in his day there was a million people like him who were radically innovative. it was a weird dream, man. it was so strange and i've had it more than once- result in very rapid technology innovation, that's for sure. it's one of the only dreams in my life i've had more than one time- okay, like where i've woken up and it's in the same dream. i'm in the same dream and in this dream it's 1940s, 1950s, but everyone is severely advanced. there's flying blimps with like lcd screens on the side of them and everything's bizarre and strange. and it stuck with me for whatever. obviously this is just a stupid dream, but for whatever reason, all these years that stuck with me. like it takes one man like nikola tesla to have more than a hundred inventions that were patents, right, i mean, he had some pretty great, pretty [ __ ] amazing ideas. yes, but there was in his day there was very few people like him. that was true. what if there was a million? like what in the end advanced very quickly, right, but there's not a million, elon musks, there's one [ __ ]. do you think i'm about that? please try to not. hmm, [Laughter], i don't think. i don't think you'd necessarily want to be me. well, what's the worst part about you? people would like it that much. well, most people wouldn't, but they can't be you. so that's like. that's like some superhero type [ __ ]. you know you wouldn't want to be spider-man, rather just sleep tight in gotham city. i hope he's out there doing his job. it's very hard to turn it off. yeah, what's the hardest part? it might sound great if it's turned on, but what if it doesn't turn off? now i showed you the isolation tank and you've never experienced that before. yeah, i think that could help you turn it off a little bit, just for the night. yeah, just give you a little bit of sleep, a little bit of perspective. magnesium that you get from the water as well, that makes you, makes you sleep easier, because the water has epsom salts in it. but maybe some sort of strategy for, uh, sacrificing your biologi- or not sacrificing, but enhancing your biological recovery time by figuring out a way, whether it's through meditation or some other ways, to shut off that that thing at night, like you must have like a constant stream of ideas that's running through your head all the time. you getting text messages from checks? no, uh, i'm getting text messages from, from friends saying what the hell are you doing? smoking weed is that bad for you, it's legal. yeah, it's kind of unapproved, it's not. you know, uh, i'm not a regular smoker of weed. how often you smoke it? almost never. i mean, it's it's- i don't actually notice any effect. well, there you go. there was a time where- i think it was ramdas or someone gave some buddhist monk a bunch of acid, okay, and he ate it and it had no effect on him. i doubt that i would say that too, but i've never meditated to the level that some of these people have, where they're constantly meditating all day, they don't have any material possessions and all of their energy is spent trying to achieve a certain mindset. i would like to cynically deny that. i'd like to cynically say: they just [ __ ] think the same way i do. they just hang out with flip-flops on and make weird noises. but maybe, no, you know, i, i, i know a lot of people like weed and that's fine, uh, but i don't find that it is very good for productivity for you, not for me. yeah, i mean, i would imagine that for someone like you- it's not someone like you- it would be more like a cup of coffee. right, you want you have a mate? yeah, it's more like the opposite of a cup of coffee. like a cup of coffee in reverse. oh, wheat is yeah. no, i'm saying you would like more. more like what would be beneficial to you would be like coffee. i like to get things done, i like to be useful. that is one of the hardest things to do is to be useful. when you say you like to get things done, like in terms of like what satisfaction when you complete a project, when something, something that you invent, comes to fruition and you see people enjoying it, that feeling, yes, doing something useful for other people, that i like, doing that's interesting for other people, yes, so that, do you think that that is maybe the way you recognize that you have this unusual position in the culture where you can uniquely influence certain things because of this. i mean you essentially have a gift, right? i mean you would think it was a curse, but i'm sure it's been fueled by many, many years of discipline and learning. but you essentially have a gift and that you have this radical sort of creativity engine when it comes to innovation and technology. it's like you're just you're going at a very high rpms all the time. what is that doesn't stop. i don't know what would happen if i got into a sensory deprivation tank? let's try it. sounds were concerning. it's like running the engine with no resistance, that's just. is that what it is, though? maybe it's not, maybe it's fine, i don't know. i'll try it. i'll try it. have you ever experienced, experimented with meditation or anything? yes, what do you do? or what have you done? rather, i mean just sort of sit there and be quiet and then repeat some mantra which acts as a focal point. it's: distill the mind. it distill the mind, but i don't find myself drawn to it frequently. do you think that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you than enlightenment? and like, or even the concept of whatever enlightenment means? like, what are you trying to achieve when you're meditating? all the time with you, it seems like almost like there's a franticness to your creativity that comes out of this, this burning furnace, and for, in order for you to like, calm that thing down, get through, you might have to throw too much water on it. it's like a never-ending explosion. like what is it like? i try to explain it to a dumb person like me. what's going on? never-ending explosion? it's just constant ideas just bouncing around. yes, damn, yeah. so when everybody leaves. it's just elon sitting at home brushing his teeth, just bunch ideas bouncing around your head, yeah, all the time. when did you realize that that's not the case with most people? i think when i was- i don't know- five or six or something. i thought i was insane. why did you think you were insane? because it was clear that other people did not what their mind wasn't exploding with ideas all the time. they weren't expressing it, they weren't talking about it all. and you realized by the time you were five or six, like, oh, they're probably not even getting this thing that i'm getting. no, it was just strange. it was like, hmm, i'm strange. that was my conclusion. i'm strange, but did you feel diminished by it in any way? like knowing that this is a weird thing that you really probably couldn't commiserate with with other people. they wouldn't understand. i hope they wouldn't find out because they might, like, put me away with something. you thought that for a second. yes, when you were little, yeah, i knew they put people away. what if they put me away? like when you were little, you thought this: yes, wow, like you thought this is so radically different than the people that are around me if they find out. i got the stream coming in, yeah, wow, but you know, i was only like five or six, so, like, do you think this is like? i mean there's there's outliers, biologically. you mean, there's people that are seven foot nine. there's people who have giant hands. there's people that have eyes that are 2015 vision. there's always outliers. um, do you feel like you like caught this, like you've got some? you're like on some weird innovation, creativity sort of wave. that's very unusual. like you, you tapped into, i mean, just think of the, the various things you've been able to accomplish in a very short amount of time and you're constantly doing this. that's a weird. you're a weird person, right, i agree. yeah, like what if there's a million elon musks? well, that would be very, very weird. yeah, it'd be pretty weird. like, right, real weird. definitely, yeah, what if they're a million joe rockets? oh, there probably is probably two million [Laughter]. i mean, i think that's the case with a lot of folks. i mean, but like, uh, you know, my goal is like, try to do useful things, try to maximize it. probably, the future is good. um, make the future exciting, something you look forward to, you know. you know, with, uh, you know with tesla, we're like trying to make things that people love. you know it's like not, i think, how many, how many things can you buy that you really love, that really give you joy? so rare, so rare. i wish there were more things. that's what we try to do: just make things that somebody loves. when you, when you think about making things that someone loves, like, do you specifically think about, like, what things would improve people's experience? like, what, what would change the way people interface with life that would make them more relaxed or more happy? you really think, like, when you're thinking about things like that, is that like one of your considerations, like, what, what could i do that would help people that maybe they wouldn't be able to figure out? yeah, like, like, what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better, like you know, like, so i think that a future where we are space, faring, civilization and out there among the stars- this is very exciting. this makes me look forward to the future. this makes me want that future. you know the things. they need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning. you wake up in the morning, look forward to the day, look forward to the future, in a future where we are space-faring civilization and out there among the stars. i think that's very exciting, that is a thing we want, whereas if, if you knew, we would not be a spacefaring civilization but forever confined to earth, this would not be a good future. that would be very sad. i think it would be so sad future of the, the, just the, the finite lifespan of the earth itself and the solar system itself that, even though it's possibly, you know, i mean, how many, how long do they feel like this sun and the solar system is going to exist? how many hundreds of millions of years? well, it's probably, if you're saying the when does the sun boil the oceans? right, about 500 million years, so is? is it sad that we never leave because in 500 million years that happens? is that what you're saying? no, i just think like, if there are two futurists and one futurist, we're out there among the stars and the things we read about and see in science fiction movies, the good ones, are true. we have these starships and we're we, we're going to see what other planets are like, and we're a multi-planet species and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations and many planets and many star systems. this is a great future. this is a wonderful thing to me and that's what we should strive for. hmm, but that's biological travel, that's cells traveling physically to another location. yes, do you think that's definitely where we're going? no, yeah, i don't think so either. i used to think so, and now i'm thinking more likely, less than ever, like almost every day, less likely. we can definitely go to the moon and mars, yeah, everything. we will go to the asteroid belt and we can go to the moons of jupiter, saturn. you can even get to pluto. that'd be the craziest place ever if we colonized mars and re-terraformed it and turned it into like a big jamaica, just i think. i think, turn the whole thing into cancun. well, i mean, over time it wouldn't be easy. but, yes, right, you could. just, you could warm it up. yeah, you can warm it up. you could add air. you get some water there. i mean, over time, hundreds of millions of years, or whatever it takes, it could be a multi-planet species. that would be amazing. the multi-planet species, that's what's ultimately like air conditioning saturn. i'm pro-human, me too. yeah, i love humanity. i think it's great. we're glad, as a robot, that you love humans, because we, we love you too and we don't want you to kill us and eat us. and uh, i mean, you know, strangely, i think a lot of people don't like humanity and see it as a blight, but i do not. well, i think one of those. i think part of that is just, they've been, you know, they've been struggling. when people struggle, they associate their struggle with other people. they never internalize their problems. they look to other people as holding them back and people suck and [ __ ] people, and it's just it. you know it's an evil, never-ending cycle, but not always. again, most people are really good. most people, vast majority. this may sound corny, it does sound cool, but love is the answer. it is the answer. yep, yeah, it is. it sounds corny because we're all scared, you know. we're all scared of trying to love people being rejected or someone taking advantage of you because you're trying to be loving. sure, but if we all could just relax and love each other wouldn't hurt to have more love in the world. it definitely wouldn't hurt. yeah, it'd be great. yeah, we should do that. yeah, i agree. man, really, how do you fix that? you have a love machine? [Laughter]. no, but, uh, probably spend more time with your friends in less time on social media. now, deleting social media from your applications, from your phones, and that give you, uh, 10 boost of happiness was what do you think the percentages? i think probably something like that. yeah, good, 10. yeah, i mean, i mean, the only thing i've kept is twitter because i kind of like need some means of getting a message out. you know, right? [Music]. that's about it. so far, so good. well, what's interesting with you? you actually occasionally engage with people on twitter. yeah, it's. what percentage of that is a good idea? [Laughter]. good question, right, it's hard. it's mostly, i think it's unbalanced, more good than bad, but there's definitely some bad. so do you ever- hopefully, the good outweighs the bad? do you ever think about how odd it is, the weird feeling that you get when someone says something shitty to you on twitter and you read it, the weird feeling, this weird little negative jolt. it's like a subjective negative jolt of energy that you don't really need to absorb, but you do anyway, like well, [ __ ] this guy [ __ ] him. i mean, there's a lot of negativity on twitter. it is, but it's a weird, it's in in its form, like the way if you ingest it, as if you're like: you try to be like a little scientist as you're ingesting it, you're like: well, how weird is this? and i'm even getting upset at some strange person saying something mean. to me, it's not even accurate. i mean the. there are a vast number of negative comments. uh, so, the vast, for the vast majority of, i just ignore them. the vast majority, yeah, but every now and again you get drawn in. it's not good. it's not good. make mistakes. yes, you can make mistakes. you can make some mistakes. we're all human. we can make mistakes. yeah, it's hard, and people love it. when you say something and you take it back, they're like: [ __ ] you, we saved it forever, [ __ ]. screenshot that [ __ ], [ __ ]. you had that thought. you had that thought. like, well, i deleted it, not good enough. you had the thought: i'm better than you. i never had that thought. you had that thought. you piece of [ __ ]. look, i saved it. i put it on my blog. yeah, i'm not sure why people think that, that anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes it go away. it's like hello been the internet for a while. yeah, well, it's even like. the thing is they don't want you to be able to delete it. because the problem is, if you don't delete it and you don't believe it anymore, it's really hard to say, hey, that thing above, i don't really believe that anymore. i change the way i, the way i view things. yes, because people go: well [ __ ]. you all right, i have that over there. i'm gonna just take that. i'm not gonna pay attention. that [ __ ] you wrote. it's on your permanent record. it's forever. bro, we'll put this on your permanent record. yeah, it's like a tattoo. you keep it. oh, yeah, yeah, well, it's, it's this thing. where there's it's, it's a. there's a lack of compassion. it's a lack of compassion issue. people just like intentionally shitty to each other all the time online and trying to catch me. it's. they're more trying to catch people doing something that's arrestable, like a cop trying to like get you know arrests on his, his record. it's like they're trying to catch you with something more than they're logically looking at it, thinking it's a bad thing that you've done or that it's an idea they don't agree with so much they need to insult you trying to catch you. yeah, i, i mean, it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person. yes, way easier. yeah, yes, it's weird, it's. it's not a normal way of human interacting. it's cheating. we're not supposed to be able to interact so easily. but people are not looking at. yes, you would never do that. you'd never be so mean to somebody looking in their eyes and if you did, you'd feel like [ __ ]. most people, yeah, unless your sociopath. you'd feel terrible. yes, elon musk, this has been a pleasure. yeah, likewise, it really has been. it's been an honor. thank you for having me, um, thanks for doing this because, uh, i know you don't do a lot of, uh, long-form stuff like this. i hope i didn't weird you out and i hope you don't get mad that you smoke weed. i mean, not bad, it's legal. we're in california. this is just as legal as this whiskey we've been drinking. exactly this is all good, right cheers. thank you, um. is there any message you would like to put out other than love is the answer, because i think you really nailed it with that. no, i think. you know. i think people should be nicer to each other and give people and give. give more credit to others and don't assume that they're mean until you know they're actually mean. you know just, it's easy to demonize people. you're usually wrong about it. people are nicer than you think. give people more credit. i couldn't agree more, and i want to thank you, not just for all the crazy innovations you've come up with and your constant flow of ideas, but that you choose to spread that idea, which is it's- uh, it's very vulnerable, but it's very honest and i it resonates with me and i believe it. i believe it's true too. so, thank you and all you [ __ ] out there, be nice, be nice [ __ ]. all right, thank you everybody. thank you very much, thank you. good night, everybody."
