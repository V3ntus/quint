"[Laughter]. [Music]: hello, mr west, what's up? what's going on? man, good to see you guys, seeing you too. we finally did it. we're here, we made it happen. we're in the building, yes, sir. so what? what are you doing? you running for president? uh, yes, what made you decide to do that? aren't you busy enough? clothing company, successful rapper, family man. it was something that god put on my heart back in 2015. uh, a few days before the mtv awards, it just it hit me in the shower and when i first thought of it, i just started like laughing to myself and it, like all this, like joy, came over my, over my body, just through my soul, and i could just i, i just felt that energy, i felt that spirit. so then, two days later, i uh accepted the michael jackson video vanguard awards at the uh mtv awards and, um, instead of performing- you know my array of hit songs, you know i gave, uh, just my perspective on award shows. but always i knew at the end i was going to tell people: i'm running for office, i'm running for president in 2020.. and you know, just to have the it, it even took heart to say it in that context and people were just like, oh, like their, their minds are blown. and then i was hanging out with different. i had different friends that were, you know, some people in the music industry, some people, tech elites, different things like that, and they would, um, really, you know, they just really took it as a joke and they're telling me all these millions of reasons why i couldn't run for president. i remember running into oprah two days or one day after that and she's like, yeah, i want to be president. and you know people, just, you know, thought projecting putting this on you, and i, i remember saying, uh, one of my responses to one of the people that one of the naysayers was, well, definitely be a billionaire by that time. uh, and not that that's a reason why someone should become president. but it's to say, you know, at that time i was, uh, 50, around 50 million dollars in debt and i knew i had the confidence that i would be able to turn that around. and now you know, just going into, i want to just give you a, a, yeah, that that's a clear answer, right, someone? i know what you're saying. i don't, i don't want to go off on two of them. no, it's okay. yeah, what you're basically saying is, you know how to set goals, you know to achieve them. but what was oprah's rationale when she said you don't want to be the president? like what was she saying? because i remember when people were saying that that's our next president. remember when trump got elected, you know, they showed oprah and they were saying, like there was- i believe it was like nbc tweeted it- this is our next president. like they, a lot of people wanted oprah to want to run and they felt like if trump could win, oprah could win. when i saw trump win, i was like, see, you can win. you know i was um, you can win if you're coming from outside of politics. i was young when ronald reagan was in, was president. i don't remember ronald reagan was the governor of california. before he was the president, he had actually proven himself as a politician, at least somewhat, which is an idea that people have thrown out at me. to to be governor california, to be governor of california, anyone's better than this guy? just do, just go ahead, start there, get a shot, open things up again, man. but i think, and i think my calling is to be- uh, i, i believe that my calling is to be the leader of the free world, not, not? i mean if, if it's in god's plan that part of my path is to be the governor, then that's fine, but my call is to be the leader of the free world. so when you say this, like when you say your calling is to be the leader of the free world, what? what does that mean to you? does that does it mean do you have a plan that's different than the plans that have been implemented before? does it mean that you have ideas? what kind of plan? like the plan to be the leader? like what would you do if you were the leader of the free world? like what would be different about the way you would handle things? like if that's your plan? like what is it about that? that that is your calling? like why, why would you want to do that? like what do you want to do differently if you were the leader of the free world? well, um, well, there was a couple questions in there. you said: why is you know? why is that your calling? there's people who will say to me, you know they'll say, well, music is bigger than politics, or more influential than politics, or celebrities or more influential. and, uh, i thought of it like if i was a pastor of a hundred thousand person church, but then i was also, um, uh, a captain, a sailor, and then we went to war and i said i'm gonna man this ship that has a thousand people, a thousand soldiers on it, because god is calling me to take this position, even though i'm the pastor. for you know, however big my audience is in hip-hop, uh, in music, or as a just an influencer or celebrity, uh, or just as a dad and a husband in my house, the world is like there couldn't be a better time to put a visionary in the in the captain's chair. um, and that's not to say we, we haven't had visionaries. be, uh, before, i'm not coming here to down any of the other, uh, i'm not here to down trump, down biden, uh, i'm just here to express why, um, uh, why god has called me to take this position. so when you say a visionary, you think of yourself in in terms of like, as an artist, as a creator, some, someone who has these thoughts that they manifest in in terms of music and art, creation, design, the things that you do. that's why you, you think you're different as a visionary. yeah, i, i, i think that i think i'm different from. i mean, we're all different, so i'm definitely different from everybody. we're all different from each other. i mean, i do bump into people that seem to be like the same character inside of. yeah, it's like i've said people before, yeah, people play the same roles. like well, i just met you before that you're just like the head of this company over here. you're the same kind of person. um, yeah, you know, i mean i manifest, i see things. i'm a great leader because i listen and i'm empathetic and i feel the entire earth and i feel us as a, as a species, as the, the human race, like i do. sometimes people think of uh, utopia as almost like a negative word, that's, that's like we couldn't have that, but i do believe in world peace, like the people hit me with. the one of the things oprah said is she said you got to bone up on your foreign affairs. i remember this, like because it's oprah talking, so i'm going to remember a lot of what the conversation was, but that's the first thing she said was: you know, uh, foreign affairs and foreign policies, like just, i think the reason why i say leader and that politician, and not even specifically uh, president is: uh, this is the time, you know when, when the constitution was written, that was an innovation. now the world is innovated all around our political system, but we haven't innovated and simplified our political system. so i met with um, this gentleman, sam uh, one of the founders of y combinator. so y combinator is a, a um is a contract that my friend, the head of dropbox, used um and that a lot of tech guys use, and it's a standardized deal. so one of the ideas i had when i was um, as i'm in this process of innovating- i'm not i'm not in war with the music industry, it's just it's time for us to innovate, uh, and we need to have contracts that make sense with exactly how we sell music. so you know people every vicinia and that's like uh, every 20 years, that's like the like decade is 10, vicinia is 20.. and, as you see, now it's like the world is just stopped for a second and there's an opportunity to look and say what are the things we need, what are the things we don't need? so i don't know if you saw, when i posted my contract, i had 10 contracts that kept on putting me inside a labyrinth and there's things that we don't need. now i believe that the distribution partner that the label is like prince would go and say, oh, we don't need the distribution partner, especially if prince was, you know, really alive and thriving in this internet era. i'm the kind of person where i'm not trying to go and eliminate anyone's job, so record labels are afraid of saying, okay, we're going to hand over the distribution completely to you guys, which is, you know, that's a possibility. there's a way where both parties can be happy and that these infrastructure partners can be of service to the influencer, to the artists like these. these deals can be flipped in a way that they're just more fair. uh, you know a record and i'll just let let me just go into the specific uh place with the record labels for a second. yeah, i'm talking about that. this is a confusing thing for people on the outside. yeah, so before, when i told my father i wanted to rap, he was, uh, very like leery of that idea. he said this: this i heard this business is terrible, and you know he's right. like people are all seeing things that are wrong inside of contracts, turning blind eyes to it, and everyone's responsible, everyone's a part of it. you know it's like when the me too movement happened, you know it wasn't just the guys that were getting tagged and you know some of the guys should have got hit with it, some guys shouldn't. you know, that's not what i'm here to talk about. i'm saying that, in a way, everyone's responsible, everyone's a part of the problem. that's why i really love that um black mirror episode, when you know everyone was making comments and anyone that even made a comment, the bees. it was about these, uh, you know, uh, mechanical bees, anyone- and this is a spoiler alert if you haven't seen this episode- but anyone who made a comment, the bees came to go get them. and that's the thing about what you put in the universe, even a thought, you know, you put that thought into the. it's another thing to say something negative and put that into the universe. it's another thing to see someone being raped. you know, that's the reason why i compare what's happening to in the music industry to me too, because artists are raped. you've heard that term before. i'm not. this is not like i'm. it's not like a new thing that i'm making up the. the contracts are made to rape the artist and, um, you know, i put my like. i i think about. you know, this is like a thought that right now it's like: is this a a negative thought that i'm putting into the universe? but i have to say, like when i was going on twitter i was thinking about bruce and brandon lee. that crossed my mind to say i'm, this is sony, this is universal and i'm willing to put the blue paint on my face and go out and do this because it's the right thing to do. like music, like at this point, it loses me money, it doesn't make. it doesn't make me money. it is my, my five billion dollar net worth and 300 million dollars of cash that i see a year. music is like negative 4 million for me. so these contracts for me were kind of like wang grow and heat, where this guy had everything but he still said wang grow, messed up. this, this, uh, this heist that we're going to do. like i look at the music industry and that music and the love of music itself. but the music industry, i look at it like wang girl, like i blame, you know the loss of my mother partially on in the entertainment industry. the always fighting to. you know, represent, you know who you are against media entertainment in an industry that's trying to tear down anybody. that's not, uh, going with the flow. i, i see, you know, i've got those kind of reasons personally, uh, but uh, vengeance is mine, said the lord, so it's not a matter of going in for revenge. that's just me as a human being where i fall short, like i'm not a monk. can you explain what you're talking about with bruce lee and brandon lee? like what i lost you there? okay, so bruce lee and brandon lee were both murdered. well, brandon lee died in an accident on a movie set. yeah, do you think it was a murder? i felt that's a conspiracy. right, the conspiracy was that the chinese triad killed him the same way they killed bruce. but this, the the coroner's report was that bruce died from, uh, a reaction to a medication, right, yeah, i mean, but i think about that anytime i go to the, go to the hospital. i'm very, you know, i'm mindful of that stuff you think about, like bob marley, they didn't just jfk or mlk him. there's like reports that it was something in his toe or he had cancer. right, i believe he had a skin cancer. yeah, like i went to go, uh, i got a shot in my uh, in my hand because, uh, just from texting and stuff, my thumb was like hurt. and then i told you so much you hurt your thumb absolutely just texting way too much. so i post a picture of, uh, the screen at the hospital and then i was asked to take it down by but who? people just call them. i forget exactly who asked me, but it was like they get. they got to my management, they got to this and they said: take that picture down. like the hospital, it was in the weirdest place, you know. so what? what did they not like about the picture? um, i think it had, like it might have had some information on it that they didn't want to go out like an address or something like that. it's just like: but i don't want to go down, go down these rabbit holes. i'm just saying, like michael jackson not waking up one day, prince not waking up one day, bruce and brandon lee, bob marley, all of these things are have crossed my mind. you know, as i'm going and saying i need to innovate, what these contracts are, not just for me but for all artists, it's not about me getting my masters back, it's about, it's about freedom. and i say, on a new song. i say, if i would put myself in harm's way to get my masters, they would put their self in harm's way to stay the master, and that's. there's a complete parallel to the way the music industry works and the way the world currently works and the influence that america has on other countries and the way governments work, uh, the influence and the way government and the way people in power and control deal with, you know, disaster relief deal, deal with haiti, deal with, uh, the bahamas- like where is the money going? why aren't things being built? and this concept of money, right, i asked myself this. um, uh, i asked someone a week ago like how much is america in debt? and they were like this, many trillion. and then i asked my a rhetorical question, but the dumbest question i've ever asked myself. i said, well, you know, how much does the earth cost? think of it, think about a bad question, but but how much is the earth worth? yeah, what is? what is the earth? what all the things on earth? yeah, and it's saying we can't buy it. we couldn't make enough money to buy the earth, right, so that means we made money. so, if money is the key to all people's happiness and we'll solve everything and everyone's doing things for money. let's just make more money. but it's not about making more money. it's about keeping poor people poor and rich people, rich and people keeping people in their place. and right now we're experiencing the fall of rome, or the titanic has now hit a glacier and there's people who would prefer to go down with the titanic than to get on a lifeboat, because they don't want to get sea water on their dress or on a nice outfit. the people are so programmed and brainwashed into, uh, classism and protectionism that, uh. it's difficult for people to embrace innovation unless it has a tag on it, it's got a name brand connected to it that says: with this innovation, you will be better than the person, you'll be better than your next-door neighbor. you know, when i made sunday service, i i completely stopped rapping because i didn't know how to rap, for god. you know, all my raps always had like um, you know like nasty jokes on it and um. and then, you know, i made um, i made uh when i, when i went to the hospital- i know you want to get into this- when i went to the hospital in 2016, i wrote: uh, start a church in calabasas. and as we left from 2018 going into 2019, i said i'm not gonna let one sunday go by without starting this church. and there's people who said it wasn't a church and different things, but to start a ministry. i'm like the little drummer boy where i'm saying: you know this, all i got to bring my my drum. i might not be well versed in the word and but i i know how to do make music and i know how to put this choir together and all things can be made good for god. so it like quickly became the best choir of all time because all the best singers moved to california and now, but a lot of them grew up in the church, so it's like the opportunity for for them to actually get paid singing for god, because i would be funding it and that for me was like a tithe for me to fund sunday service and i was four months in before i gave my life to god like i wasn't saved. it's just. i had a calling saying: just go make this church and the whole thing. the comparison to this church, to me going and saying, okay, why, why am i running for president, is to be in service and that's service to my, my own ego. uh, you know, i feel like god says to me: like haven't i given you enough and i gave you an ego that helped you overcome all these, you know roadblocks and smoke screens and people telling you what you can't do. now you need to realize when you're doing things for your ego and when you're doing things for me. this is like god, the, what i feel god is saying to me. uh, because it really irritates me when people say: god told me to tell you. so i'm very like, mindful with this kind of word and this i'm saying i have a feeling that that's what god is saying for me. to be in service, so the ultimate service position is leader of the free world. to be the president of the united states- it's. sometimes you see me on twitter. i'll say i want all the smoke, i want all the problems, because the problems are the opportunities. there's an opportunity to solve things. and kurzweil- uh, he created the keyboard. kurzweil, uh, he, he has this video that marco manik, this uh director that shot 99 problems for jay-z, which is like my favorite, uh, maybe like top five or top two favorite videos of all time. uh, he also did a closer for trent rezner and i like i just grew up on mtv in the 90s and i love mark romantic videos, but he would share, um, he'd share little bits and pieces. i remember ray curls, kurzweil, talking about the ability for us to have a utopia, but us being led by the least noble and the most greedy. but if someone, or when someone gets in a position of leadership that is in service to god and in service to people, period, but immediately the american people, um, i had this joke. i was saying, like man, no one outside of our country should be able to see these debates. this is family business right here. this is only for america to see. we can't let anyone outside the country see it- but to be in service. so i, i stepped away already from my rap career for a year and served god every week, sometimes twice a week, three times a week. never missed a sunday until covet. and, um, and this thing, there were people inside of the church stealing, doing different things, trying to just take them, and god still provided a way for us to keep that boat afloat. we never missed a. we never missed, uh, a service. and then, uh, one of my pastors, pastor adam, who is uh, uh, uh, the way he preaches is is called expository. it's like one to one by the word. i like all different kind of preachers, but there's some type of preachers- they they get up, they have the bible in their hand, then they close the bible and then they just talk for, uh, two hours and it's and, and some do have anointing, but the expository preachers go line for line and for me it's like i come from entertainment. i got so much sauce- i don't need no sauce on the word, i need the word to be solid food- that i can understand exactly what god was saying to me through the king james version- do this, you know, um, through this translation, or the english shannon version. so pastor adams was coming by my spot, uh, i got this 300 acre spot in um calabasas, uh, that we had a little house in that i was recording and i would play this music, these chords that i love. they're almost like monk-like um, and that's going to go into something we'll talk about later, because i'm building a modest, i'm building them a monastery that will then be the future of uh monasteries. this like uh, full sustainable energy. now, uh, he says to me. pastor adam says to me when i was thinking about. should i rap or not? he said. my son just said: you know, i wish i want to hear yay rap do album about jesus, a rap album about jesus, and it was through the mouth of babes like this person. i'm gonna listen to the kids, bro, you know, i'm gonna listen to my daughter. i'm gonna listen to kids before i listen to you know, super programmed out adults, and especially if that adult hasn't done something that i am looking to do, right, uh. so it's so funny how people are so like free and almost arrogant with their advice and i'm just like why would i listen to you? you don't even ask me for any advice. i'm the most successful person i know. so the um, um. so he said my son wants to hear a rap album from yay and that, just that was. that was the paradigm shift for me. i used that word a lot. i like that. i like paradigm shift. it's one of my favorite, the and i. i made this rap album and you know, for a lot of people it was the first album that they could play with a certain production level in the house, with their, with their, with their family. now, you know, you could argue if the watch the throne production was stronger or better than uh jesus king production. but when i go and i like i've been working with dr dre and some of the beats and just be like you know the hardest beats possible, and it's something that was very spiritual and meditative about the mix on jesus king that it wasn't hitting as hard as jesus or hitting as hard as uh watch the throne. it was like this is how god wanted me to make this, uh, make this sonic painting and the way he wanted me to communicate then. so we did that album and then we did the jesus's born album, which also i got that idea from pastor adams, uh, and i mean there's people who that's the only album they play and it's just bringing these gospel and i tell you like my formula for these hymns i'm writing because i'm writing the, the songs that we're doing at uh sunday service is basically my book of hymns for the future gospel university that i'm creating, where i've envisioned and will manifest a 200 000 seat stadium circular with a hundred thousand gospel singers and people will go to this university and they will train the way. you know a russian olympic swimmer, you know a picture like they would be in the pool six days a week at least, if not seven days, but for people who sing for the church or you know, uh, you know, because it's, it's, it's a tide, it's pro bonus. all this like people don't practice that as much as we practice going to studio to rap or practice, uh, playing basketball if we're in the nba. so it's making the nba sort of say, uh, the coliseum for god and what that have. have you like, heard, like soccer chants and like, and just like sixty thousand persons. so i envisioned that for god, a hundred thousand people, sometimes singing in, uh, harmony, sometimes in unison, glory, glory, oh god, almighty, we lift our hands and give you praise, glory, glory, oh god, almighty, we lift our hands and give you praise for picture, a hundred thousand people in unison and that feeling. what that would do for our spirits, our souls. it's healing. there's natural forms of healing about our environment, um, the friends that we're around, what we're wearing, what we're eating, our diet. so donde is a design company that, um, that uh, i formed around 10 years ago, and some of the people that worked at donda are now have went on to become heads of fashion houses, like, uh, virgil's, the head of louis vuitton, and he was the head of donda at a certain point. another guy that worked at donda is now the head of givenchy. so this is like the, the talent pool, and this donda is basically my version of, like a cyber, you know, extension of my brain, like here's something that i'm thinking of, that you can't touch, but we need to. we need to bring it into fruition, we need to manifest it and we have to see how to use things of our past and things of our now to create our future. so it's a organization, um, created to guarantee the future of the human race. really, i thought about even calling it edna, because i see us all as superheroes and aetna was the designer in the incredibles, which is kind of almost really similar to donda. i'm just seeing these lineups and stuff. so, um. so now our focus is food, clothing, shelter, communication, education and transportation. so at the school that i just created, easy christian academy, you know we call nasa, we call different places about this hydroponic vertical growing uh garden and i remember sitting. you know the idea of the garden is from a to z, you have to be able to make your food right there, fully sustainable, right there on your land, and you know there's a bunch of people like, oh, i made this salad right here. it's like i'm not that good enough, you still gotta go to the grocery store for eighty percent, sixty percent of your stuff. i remember this one, you know, um, this one farmer we had, you know he wanted to build this class for the kids and all this. we're going to show the kids this thing. people always make the kids version. i don't like this, the kids version thing. like kids need to understand how- what if the pandemic was? you know, they lost all their parents and it was lost. the kids need to understand early how real life works. so physics is one of the anchors of the school that i'm creating. i remember, you know i'm uh, the city is all self-sustaining, so it works off of our four main resources: earth, wind, uh, water and and fire. and uh, 90 of it is running off of water, with like aqueducts, like the city of masada. and i was talking to this engineer, um, and saying i need the whole thing to run off of water, and he said: well, we're gonna have to use solar power. i said i don't and please, you know, don't take this as any offense- i don't like solar panels. i feel that they're part of still of what edison's idea was. i don't feel like they're really in line with what nikolai tesla really wanted to do with alternative current. i mean getting into the whole tesla and what edison did to take tesla down and the fact the world would probably be free by now if ted, if tesla, wasn't basically destroyed by the media that edison controlled in the propaganda that edison control. so i'm i'm talking to my engineer and saying this needs to run completely with water and i don't want to use uh, a solar anyway. and he says no, i'm saying we're going to use a mirror and it's going to connect to a steam uh engine and that's going to push the water back up. and i was like after like screaming at the guy, i was like, look, if i had known physics, i wouldn't have been screaming at my engineer. so if we think about what we're learning in school to learn physics, to learn farming, i was uh. i was talking to um, a friend of mine that's a uh, a rapper and super, uh, super, uh, god following spiritual, super smart, and i was showing her the um, uh, uh, some of the designs for uh, the monasteries and some of the designs for the fully sustainable communities, all the same thing. and then it said bioengineering on it and she said: what do you she it's like, for her bioengineering has a negative connotation and my response was: isn't like farming and cooking, like bioengineering at the, at the simplest form, like we went to going from like grabbing apples off of a tree to, oh, we put this boom in the ground, oh, and we could grow this and we could grow this. you know we could grow this harvest right here. so it's you know. i want to just sim, simplify and round up the. the principle behind, uh, the donda way of thinking is: we've got all this information and all this, you know, these science, scientific um, uh, exploration, these things that tesla never completed, these things that da vinci never completed, and we can look at all of these things and see how do we create the most primitive versions of this to create a fully sustainable ecosystem, which is, you know, what covet actually helped us to. you know, get closer to our families, get closer to our children. uh, understand, like, oh, wow, that you know that was mapped out for us to be 50 minutes away from our home and our kids school to be 30 minutes away and to put us in traffic for that amount of time. and these cities have been designed to promote industry and just to make more money. they haven't been designed to promote happiness. so we're at this paradigm shift in our existence. you know it was when muhammad hit the market- i think that's who it was- and brought money, because before it was slave and trade. and this is something you know, dishonorable men honor money. i got this bar from dave chappelle- i'm not trying to like steal his bar, uh. and you know we as human beings, this, this race on earth, have like been honoring money. and you know money isn't, it's not even real. you know it's not even backed by anything. i don't want to like go too far into that, but when you unprogram yourself, you see that there's other forms of currency now, like relationships are a more important currency than money itself. and that's what we really saw. it's like the end of the movie that our existence would be pre-coveted post covet. and so, as the titanic is crashing and sinking and rome is falling, there's got to be this new civilization, like the end of tron, where everything starts to light up. and it's been under this like dark cloud. so you know god is using me and he has a calling, you know, in my life, to make the world better for all people. like people say there's bad people, there's good people, no, there's, there's. there's people that are possessed, that have demonic ways, but we were all children at one time. they say some people, no, they were born bad. you got to remember. like say: oh, there's bad people, even even the devil's an angel, a fallen angel, a lost angel, like los angeles, if you think, let me, but that's the city of angels, let me, let me. let me start from the beginning. so you, you essentially deconstruct things. so when you say in in many ways, when you're describing yourself as a visionary- this is what i'm saying- is you're looking at all the systems that are in place, whether it's the record industry, um, the contracts that are wrong with artists, the way civilization is set up- i think visionaries too glossy and too saucy of a title, okay, whatever. you're deconstructing all of these things and you find flaws in the systems. so, all these systems, whether it's the, the music industry system, whether it's the political system, whether it's the, the system of gathering food, whether even a religious system, like i remember when you started doing your sunday service and my friend was: like what is he doing? i go, he's making going to church cool again, like you don't think that's. look at all these people having a great time. you've thousands of people that are chanting and singing along like he's not asking for anything. i go, look. if anybody should be doing something like that, it's him. i go because he's making great music. everybody's having a good time and what do you get out of that? the best thing that people ever get out of church is sense of community, a time where you get together and you all agree this is where you're going to concentrate on good. you're going to concentrate on goodness. you're going to concentrate on on and trying to find these shared values that are going to help the community. now you're doing this in this mass form. you got the superstar musician who's doing this in this mass form with thousands and thousands of people in these gigantic areas, like that's nothing but positive. so you deconstructed the idea of how- how to do a religious service but make it cool- and now you're thinking about deconstructing all these different things. you're thinking about deconstructing how- how food is harvested. you're thinking about deconstructing how we make energy. you're literally trying to deconstruct and and reimagine the idea of civilization. yeah, exactly so talk me through how this starts with you have you, were you always religious your whole life? yes, i was, and then i, you know, then i hit high school [Laughter]. so, but you, you know, when you're a young man and you're, you know you're a superstar musician and you know you're living a wild life. what, what was it that led you back to this? just a feeling in your life that there was more to life, there was more to your position, there was more to you know, this idea of a calling that you felt like you could do more and that it it resonated with you more to, to, to produce these sunday services and to to start thinking of, of life in this way, like you can improve things. yeah, god knocked me off my horse. god, like literally called me and said: okay, now i need you, i need you. right now i need- i mean not that god needs, needs me. we need god, but he called me to serve him and i was tired of serving the music industry to start, tired of serving, you know, filling up stadiums. uh, you know, when the last concert, last tour, i did, we had a floating stage and uh, and actually it was a hanging stage but it looked like it was floating and that's just another thing. that's illusion, where we need to dispel the illusion. i wouldn't even call it the floating stage today, but the whole thing about is people used to say how i would lose money on tours because i would put so much into the creative. and i and i was, like, wanted to prove. but prove to who you know, prove to man, prove to greedy people. you know that i could make more than anybody. and that's like the gladiator position that all artists are put into. like we're in the middle of this coliseum. let me show you: i can kill more lions and tigers and bears and people and blah, blah than any other gladiators that happen. so that's what i'm, that's what i was doing. and then i remember talking to james terrell and i was like at the top of my lungs, like screaming about saving uh, saving ourselves and humanity, and the reason why me and james needed to uh connect. and then i went to uh my show. and then it's like my like this, like my head popped back and the spirit jumped out and it felt like it was like my mom talking and the last thing i said was: this thing is over, and i'm saying it like i sound like my mom, like donda, like that's something she would have said if she was in the physical form when she sees her son, you know, exhausted like i just went through. uh, uh, i had this uh fashion show. we had this fashion show where we took over msg and just broke all boundaries, sold 20 000, 16 000 seats and played the new album and uh, it was you know, a thousand black people in the show and, yeah, like all young thug plugging in the iphone and uh, travis and cuddy dancing- he had 50 cent there, jay-z there, lamar odom, the uh, the first time that people you know saw him and walk again, uh was, we walked together into the, into the stadium, uh, and he's camo yeezy jacket, all head to toe. and the reason why that was so important is like when he was in a coma, i would come by and play him the new music and once he was out of the coma he said that he remembered that music when he was in a coma and that was the album i was playing that day. so that's the reason why me and lamar uh walked in together and then the next, a few months later, i did a fashion show and it started 45 minutes late and the media, they just killed me, they lebrond me, as i would say, like when lebron went to uh, to um, uh, miami, and they said: you know who are you to have a, a choice? you know like what? uh, one of my other heroes, tom brady, he, he left. i didn't see no jerseys getting burned, like when lebron uh left. so then, less than a week after that, my wife is robbed in paris and so we, we, just because i'm i'm in the middle of a tour, while i'm doing the fashion show, while i'm doing this, so we cancel the tour because it's- it's very, you know, traumatic. and then you know, we start the tour back up and we get back into it, and then i i just keep on saying i want to go to japan. i just want to go to japan because japan is like a way that people treat there isn't like the systemic racism embedded in every single individual that's inside of the place, like in america, uh, black, white, anything- there's a systemic, uh, white, white supremacy, like when i tag you know, white supremacy, or we say this, it's like the um, yes, that is america, that is the world currently. we've been taught that my first superhero was superman, you know, and my dad was a black panther. but you know, when disney makes black panther now, when you look it up, you don't see my dad protecting his neighborhood or snatching a mic out of somebody's hand while they're lying. i don't know. you know, like father, like son, right there, uh, but you see this character that's made for black people to idolize, that was designed by a white, white person and put out by a white company. so it's controlling the narrative to say we're going to show you harriet tubman, we're not going to show you not turner, and they do it every chance. they get maleficent, uh, um, they called her her race of people, the moors, and the moors are, and i just saw it again. i was just like yo. if you erase our history, like most black people, we don't know or we come. we think we came from slaves. we don't know our bloodline and we're, we're given black history month and we take that like it's some gift to us. no, it's a programming to us. racism doesn't end until we get to a point where we stop having to put the word black in front of it because it's like we're. we're putting the rim a little bit lower for ourselves. like it's when i say i'm the second wealthiest black man in america, like why do i have to say that? because you know, obviously, if we just go on wealth period of what we call wealth, like financial wealth, that score card, you know i'd be like i'm the, i'm the 78th wealthiest man in america. but we shouldn't have to have a special box, a special month, because also, what they show in black, black history month is us getting hosed down, reminding us that we were slaves. like what if we had remember when i cheated on you month? like, remember when you first found the, found the text messages? remember? how does that make you feel? it makes you feel depleted and defeated. you know, it's no matter what religion you are. what we can agree on is: it is always now, but now is the shortest moment of our life. it's gone in an instant. the longest moments of our life are our memories and our imaginations. think about how long a kid imagines christmas before i mean, versus how long christmas really is. and when you think back to your christmas, are you under the table like jim carrey and eternal sunshine, with a spotless mind, like under a chair or are you a giant? are you a king? are you? what blac, what, what black history month has told you? you are, and this is me speaking to uh. you know black people, specifically in america, that you know. i know people who would, you know, kill someone in, uh, or have a gunner you know in in their own hood and be afraid to go downtown and literally be like, afraid of white people, like the most gangster gang of gangsters wouldn't go downtown. and that's just a programming. but that program is inside of the curriculum, it's an instant side of the media, it and it, and it goes to this whole idea of yay. when people say: is jay crazy, is a a narcissistic, is a, uh, egomaniac? is yay self-absorbed of jay, all these, no, yay know who, yay is. i know who i am and i'm not fin. i'm not fit to bow to uh, to an idea that you want to have of me. i am going to be the full idea that god has of me and when i do things that are that god don't like, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm being the lesser version of me. this is where i, you know, in my weakness, god becomes strong. i have to be the higher me, when, when people are downing me, it's not like me fighting fire with fire, me attacking or, as you say, like you know, stooping to uh, stooping to that level, it's like the devil will use you against you. you become your own, uh, you become your own worst enemy. and i just went on a riff right there. but the thing is, these isn't that what you do, though, like yeah, yeah, one of the things that i, when anybody ever talks about you to me, they, they, they say, well, he's all over the place. and i say, i think that he's got a different power source. like, if you look at the way everybody interfaces with the world, if there's a universal power, most people have like a 20 watt charger. the way i describe you, i say i think that [ __ ] got like 150 watt charger, and these ideas are just coming at them. so you do go on these rants that sometimes need to be dissected into individual things, but overall you're incredibly productive. so my question is: why do you? why do people think there's something wrong with you? yeah, this is, but legitimately, like you've been medicated, they've, they've put you away right, they've brought to you. how did that happen? well, i'll say these two things i think, uh, very three-dimensionally. i don't think in the black and white lines that i've been programmed to think in, and i and i think in full color. so when i talk, i have to describe a thought in five ways. you know, we, we enjoy food that has multiple seasoning in it. we enjoy music that has multiple instruments. so when i talk, it's not a rant, it's a symphony of ideas, and when you collect them you say, oh, these are all these things that connect. yeah, you know, i, i, i just tell the truth, and telling the truth is crazy in a world full of lies. that's simply it. but none of the things you're saying are crazy. another things you said are crazy. it's fascinating the way you think, because i can see that you're thinking in all these different layers and you're looking at things from all these different perspectives and they all come together out of your mouth in like a tornado of ideas. now, if someone wants to just have a conversation with you back and forth, i could see whether you go. this guy's crazy just doesn't stop. he's ranting, but what i'm seeing is just, you're a very thorough thinker. you're thinking at things independently, but you're thinking of things in a massive perspective. now, who convinced you that that's bad? is it? have you always been this way or were you less? is it? was it less manageable before? did you have issues with it before? yeah, i believe, before i found christ and gave my life to god. i would try to lean on my own understanding. and that's the universe is like a black hole of information. what do you mean by your own understanding? meaning, when people ask, einstein said: you're the smartest person. what would you like to know he? his einstein's response was: i'd like to understand the mind of god. meaning, meaning: god is all-knowing and we can only know or see- and for me as a visionary, we can only know or see what god allows us to see and what he feels we're ready to see and understand to, to maximize what our mass laws hierarchy and e chart is. you know what sets our dopa means, what sets our serotonins off, what makes us feel good. basically, like you know we, we did a good deed and it's like it was somehow where you know. you know, just doing a beat for a famous per or just doing a beat for um, a local dope rapper, really meant a lot to me when i was 14 years old doing a beat for just anyone famous that had a major record deal was a lot to me at age 19.. me being able to, you know, put out my own music and put my own i was a lot to me at age 24, meaning, as i grow, god sets new stages in the game of life. for me, that you get your satisfaction, like maslow's hierarchy of need, is like our satisfaction chart: what makes us feel whole and, uh, accomplished as a, as a, as a human being. so, as i go through these different levels, there's times where i would use confidence when i knew what i was doing and i would use arrogance when i didn't know what i was doing. but i'd rather use arrogance than to let someone diminish my idea of myself, because that is what keeps us going: hope actually keeps us alive. anybody you ask most people, is like: do you want tomorrow to come? and they say, yes, they have, they have hope for it. but i went from having confidence and arrogance to having faith, and faith is the opposite of fear and that created this fearless approach that i have and that's what made now, has made me the fearless leader that i am, that i've like crystallized into the leader that my mom always knew i would be when kids followed me in preschool. the leader that people saw when we changed the sound of music. the leader when we changed, uh, the, the sneaker industry. the leader and what we're doing with, uh, with farming and with with shelters- when i was building, you know, the homeless shelters, uh, a couple years ago, and visiting parks and, and then going to skip row and understanding the uh, uh, the dynamics and empathizing with what actual mental health issues are, not someone you know, telling their truth or being exhausted and then being labeled as such, like i am. so that's what you felt happened to you, like you were absolutely truth and you were exhausted and they labeled you as mentally unhealthy- yes, absolutely. am i saying this? right, that what happened with you is? you feel like, maybe, or you probably feel like that having this higher calling and recognizing this higher power was the, the glue that kept your thoughts together, they kept your mind straight and it kept you on a righteous path. so, instead of being scattered with all these crazy thoughts and being exhausted and being labeled manic, right, like we talked before and you were saying that they had you on medication, but the medication [ __ ] with your creativity. it [ __ ] with all kinds of things, or it blocked my ability to channel what god wanted me to do. but we're all- we're all- on medication right now. did you use toothpaste with fluoride today? it blocks your pineal gland and they put children on it and we put- we put our kids on it. you know we. it's inside the. the deodorants that we use. is all these things to create like a disconnect to god, to serve that? it's like are you serving man? are you serving the, the one and only master? but what did they tell you when, when they said that they were going to put you on medication? what do they put you on? and what did they tell you? one of my favorite things that they did is they put me on this medication that made me, uh, gain a lot of weight. and i said i'm not gonna take this. and they said, okay, we got a medication you could take, but you won't gain weight. and this shows you. they were trying to kill a superhero slowly, trying to kill genius, trying to make me not feel like i could run for president, make me not feel like i can go, uh, be born in atlanta, grow up on the south side of chicago, go into music, go and win all these grammys, change the sound of music and the look of stage performances- all that and then still end up in 53 million dollars in debt. what music industry has people going to the exact debt of the house that they think they're gonna buy after the tour is over? and it's, and it's, it's strategized. there's criminals all over everyone's almost accounts in the music industry. it's not a safe place. it's a. it's a treacherous place, so filled with money. soon as things are filled with money, they're filled with people that are trying to take advantage of other people. it's filled with money. bees come to honey. exactly, exactly, so they put. they put you on this ship because you were exhausted. what did they put you on? um, um, you know i'm, i can, i can research. i'm actually forgetting the exact medication that they had. um, but what did it do? uh, you, the main thing that it did is? it destroyed my confidence. it made me this shell of who i really am. it like grayed over my eyes, it, it, it made me. it made the mustang that buck anymore. hmm, they sedated you, yes, yeah, and they. what was the? the thought process behind it when you talked to a doctor about this, what did they tell you was wrong with you? uh, they. they told me i was bipolar and i remember going on tmz and saying: you know, slavery is a choice, and they medicated me for saying that, for having that opinion and saying it out loud. but as i put those contracts up, i'm saying: this is a choice, as i, you know, you didn't mean people being abducted and brought into slavery and put into chains- was a choice. what you were talking about is people making decisions that would enslave them financially and enslave their life. yeah, it was taken out of context and it was taken in the least charitable way and they decided to try to say: look at crazy kanye, look at this [ __ ] he's saying, and then they medicate you. yes, and the media has always taken anything out of context that isn't a part of the overall narrative. yeah, that, because there's, you know, like hollywood and media has controlled so much of the narrative. and then he had silicon valley. and that's what's so beautiful about one of my heroes, steve jobs, because there wouldn't be a silicon valley or the silicon valley wouldn't be what it is today, if steve jobs didn't make information accessible like this, which is still a bit controlled, but it feels like twitter is the the safest, fleet, freest, uh, mass platform to communicate on, and you know it's like they mess with jack because of that. you know, you know well it's it's still censored. there's a lot of issues now, but i think that's internal. i think that's people that are working there that are woke, that want to stop people from saying certain things, and there's a lot of struggles with that today, and i it's unfortunate because i i do agree that it's an unbelievable way to get ideas out there. yeah, so, but it's also it's a new thing, and it's mismanaged by the people that use it. often they don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it. every version of anything that man has made will be flawed, sure, and it has to go through a bunch of different steps of evolution. it has to, it has to evolve and change. so why did you agree to let them do this to you? why did you agree to let them medicate you? because if that is that, look, i'm crazy for sure. but if someone came to me and go, hey, we're going to put you on some medication, that medication is going to calm you down, i'd be like everything i do is because i'm not calm. everything that i've ever done that's made me successful is because i have more energy. it's because i i have a wildness, like i'm not calming that down, like i know how to calm myself down. i can self-medicate with exercise and meditation and marijuana and a bunch of different things, but i'm not gonna- i'm not gonna- take some medication that removes anything that's unique with you and all these wild ideas that come to your head. like very few people could string together these thoughts the way you're describing them today. if somebody asked me if there's anything wrong with him, he's [ __ ]. he's filled with awesome. like, what's what's wrong with that? if you can keep that together, what you just did, the way you just described reimagining civilization, reimagining church, reimagining the food supplies- there's nothing bad about that. this is all very interesting and very good. like i would never say that's bad. but are you this way all the time? or is there good versions of kanye and versions of kanye where you don't feel like you have a grip on these thoughts? you know, what i love is there was, uh, some perspectives that people showed about what a true manic episode really looks like. after i was in south carolina and this one guy was talking about his mom being in an episode and kidnapping his brother and you know, like proper extreme cases, you know i cried and was gut wrenched like at the. i don't even like to say out loud what i s, what i said on south carolina, but the idea of- you know, i'm just trying to word it in a way that's really safe and covers my family- um, people saw this clip of me crying. some people didn't know what i was crying about, but i was crying about that there was a, a possible chance. you know, i'm just- i'm looking at a way to say this- that there was a chance, that you know that we didn't make that kim and i didn't make the family we have today. that's much that's my most like, uh, family friendly. you know way to word that and just the idea of it just tears me up inside that i was a part of a culture that promotes this kind of thing. like one of the? uh major statistics on the subject of life is um, that the greatest advocates for um, the a, the a word is- are men from ages 31 to 37, and that's how old i was and i felt like i was too busy, my dad felt like he was too busy for me, and we have a culture of that and they have a child rebel soldiers that were in africa that would be doped up and psyched out and made to kill their parents were. well, in our culture. we're doped up and psyched out and made to kill our children. you know we have to decouple the conversation of, uh, planned parenthood and woman's choice now. so of course i'm christian, so i'm pro-life, um, and when i go into office i'm not changing laws, because i realize we live in an imperfect world, in an imperfect society. what i will be presenting is a plan a- and we've already started to work on plan a- to change the connotation of orphanages, to change the connotation of foster care, and not just change the connotation, you know, verbally, but to create places that are to the level of, like the amman, geary and disney world, how to had a kid. you know what is this like, and we have so much land that this can be created and then spread across the world to orphanages in africa and in china and just um uh across the globe, to to create these environments that when there's expecting families, moms and fathers that they feel like there's a place, even if they don't feel well off enough to bring another life into this world, that there's a place to go. there's a plan a because plan b and planned parenthood were planned by a eugenics that set out and said out loud: i'm doing this to kill the black race and to create population control. you know, if we what are you saying? plan b mean the pill, meaning the, the morning-after pill. you know what? let me planned parenthood. let me, let me, let me decouple those things. let me, let me talk about planned parenthood. okay, there's. the last figure i saw is there were 210 000 deaths due to covet in america, and everywhere you go you see someone with a mask on, with a, the a word, a culture- i'll say it one time- with abortion culture. there are 1 000 black children aborted a day, daily. we are in genocide, we so more black children have died in the past, since february, than people have died of covet and everyone wears a mask. so it's a matter of where are we turning a blind's eye to? like? the media can control a lot of times. it has to control what we care about. i even heard somebody say at one point- this is the actual sentence. i heard someone say: puerto rico so played out, meaning there was a time where people were caring about it, and now the media says: don't care about it, but these people? it still hasn't been solved, the the hurricane's still hit, the earthquakes still hidden, people are still suffering from that and no one has really gone to fix it. and when that 11 billion goes to haiti and it doesn't get to the people, you know, the daily mail post a, a swimsuit pick or something and uh, deters our energy to what we have to do collectively, to, to, to, to help our brothers and sisters. you know, i look at society as as one body. i want to just go into this rift because my thoughts are like these clouds and mario brothers, and i'll jump to this and i'll see another one. i'll jump to another and say, oh, yes, i jump to another. i need to express this, uh, this story. i believe that, you know, love will heal all and we have to look at, i believe. i believe that world peace is possible and i believe it's us looking at each other as a moment in time. time is love. you love the things you put time into. that's where i'm in. time is love like, because this is like, uh, this intangible thing, this thing you can't grab, you can't just grab time in your hand, you can't grab love in your hand, but but we feel both of these things are real for us to love one another. just as simple as that. like love will heal the world. this is what it's gonna take to heal the world. but we have a competitive spirit. we like having a bad guy, we like having a competitor. so what we need to do is change the bad guy, change the competitor. make the competitor be the roman era, the roman civilization. make the uh competitive. be the egyptian kingdom and say: we are the first society, we're the first civilization that ever became civil, because we are still just as much in the dark ages as medieval times or as game of thrones. you know level, uh, black mirror, level i. i know i went past future, other dimension for a second, but we kill each other. we kill each other on social media. we kill each other in high schools, like in the way with that we talk to each other. we, we physically kill each other in our own neighborhoods and outside of neighborhoods. you know this planet when we, when we keep turning a blind's eye to our brothers and our sisters and our family, which is us as a whole, as all of humanity, then, of course, it's going to get to the point where there's, you know, homeless sleeping under, you know a? um? a bridge in calabasas, because we ignored the homeless person sleeping in front of the gucci store. how do you, how does just look at that visual? it's a homeless person sleeping in front of the gucci store. we have builders. we have people who know how to make communities. we have people who know how to cook and how to make food and how to, um, how to bring this food. people are fighting over land and not really realizing that we're not, uh, we're not, maximizing our resources and our existence. we've got genius level scientists. we've got people who rogue- uh, you know, people who have, uh, broken out of the chains, like elon. like, imagine if elon was working at gm on the third floor, somewhere, you know, we wouldn't have electric cars, we wouldn't have that new porsche hybrid, we wouldn't have, uh, uh, what. what's happening with, you know, hyperloop? imagine if the guy that, uh, you know, started airbnb, uh, uh, was shut down, or the guys who started uber were shut down. all of these people who break away and then create the new society and the next frontier where we're going. people like i've said, like it feels to me like mit is a place that has to be funded by people who want to take the smartest people on the planet and make them work on the smallest things. that won't change anything, and i've talked to people from mit and i could look at these brill, like this brilliant person. i was talking from mit and he was. he was afraid. everything was fear, everything was about his, his girlfriend's pregnant and you know we just got a house and i don't want to do anything to change this and i- and this is like one of the most brilliant people on the planet. but if you mix brilliance with bravery, that we can ignite something. even this conversation alone can ignite the people that are going to change the world, because there's people who have been anointed. you can't teach the brilliance and the anointings. there's people who hit the game of life and they've got something that they're going to do, no matter what school they go to. they know. they just know how to do it. they knew how to do it before they got here and they were going to do it, and these people just need to see what it looks like to overcome the smoke screens of public humiliation, of bankruptcy- i was in debt, uh- the fear loss i lost my mom, or the fear of death. you know what other fears uh are there? there's a lot of fears, but the thing is, when you remove- like even in the schools, you remove prayer, you remove god, you remove the fear of god, you create the possibility of the fear of everything else. but watch this: if you instill the fear of god, you eliminate the fear of anything else. and it's not that i am fearless. i am definitely, literally, definitely shaking and in so much fear of my father, i fear god and i don't fear nothing else. there's some power to that, right like it just has a mental management tool. there's some real power to that because so many people are afraid of every single little aspect of life: bills and debt and love and relationships. and if you have a higher power- and this is one of the things that i've always wanted to make- what's the main word that you use, even for fear? this is the main disease that that people use in politics. it's the main fear, is it? but it's a main word. it's the disease attacking the world because it it it destroys your, it changes your posture, it changes your idea. it's worry, yeah, worry, yeah, anxiety, that's right. that's what it is. stress like it can kill you. you can't be free. you can't be free to take chances to be worried about stuff like an honest yeah. so to be able to anchor and eliminate worry and say this: i am walking in a righteous path and i don't have to worry about anything. i don't have to worry about going to jail. i have to worry about being killed. i don't have to worry about bankruptcy. i don't have to worry about um, you know, uh, humiliation, you know, because this comes. this is where smart alec prayers can get you. i used to have this really smart outlet prayer. i said god, deliver me from pain. and then he took my mom- so it's hard to hurt that much ever again- and create it almost like a character like deadpool. i'm like deadpool for god. like there's no noise. there's no human noise that can. and you know, someone tried to like there was. there was a friend of mine that did like a really bad move, where he tried to say i was using this, this, this lawyer, and i was about to work with him and he said- the lawyer said he wouldn't work with you until you get my contract done. and i was just like having, do you not know me at all? i'll be the type to cut off my. if my hands are like this, i'll cut off my own hand. i come back in the room they'd be like: yo, what you doing here? i thought we tied you up. i'm like, and then i go just make like a luke skywalker, you know, you know han. and this is one thing i want to say like, and it's about to make me mad right here, the first time you see me get mad in the interview they said that george lucas's prequels are worse than the corporate made disney star wars. i'll get mad at that too. like that's [ __ ] ridiculous revenge of the sif. we saw how darth vader was made. yeah, like, i watched that like 10 times. doing covet, like don't jump anakin, i got the high ground. those early movies were pure. they were pure. no, no, i'm saying even the prequels are better than anything that. and i'm sorry, disney star wars design team, i know you're gonna like put my face up in the you know office and be like: forget no man, this is george, this is his baby. that thing was set in his heart to show us his children the hero's journey, you know, and these, these, like, how can we running back and replay, like even at disney, you know there's, there's people, you know, at a pixar that have left. people have left you know where, um, uh, they call- i've forgot the exact title- but saying like, every time is a new idea, they call it like an unproven idea. so they'll get to toy story 800 000 and frozen trillion before there's a new concept. uh, to take a chance on. yeah, to take a chance, yeah, and we've been, we've been programmed, like when you see the, you know the homes, the style of homes that i've been developing. they're far closer to the way the galaxy looks, the way water looks, the way our makeup in our body feels. uh, we've been, uh, we've been put into these boxes and that was, you know, due to money. they do the construction that we have to be in these, these boxes, and we've been stuck in a loop, like on uh, westworld and something. i feel like tandy newton on westworld, where she had to use the people that enslaved her, that trapped her, to make it, to make it out. you know the uh, and it's funny when i like the box and when i'm talking about farming. i had a point about farming that i didn't finish earlier. i hired this guy to do the a to z concept. i made it plain as day: make it so: everything we cook in the kitchen at the school, we plant it here and they would just do it to 70 percent. they'd do it to 60 percent. earlier, when i had that point, i went to this whole riff about children needing to learn physics and children needing to learn how to really do things and not having this separated thing like we are programmed to lock ourselves in a box. and what's amazing right now is the opportunity and the platform that we have, that the world is hurting for everyone, for those that are in power, for those that are inside the program. even those that are in power are still a part of the program. and you know- i read this uh, this tweet, that someone said i finished watching netflix. what's next? and that's so true that we can't even program enough to satisfy ourselves. the program is done. forrest gump has stopped running and just turned around. it's like all of this thing is a setup: the, the, the, the concerts that musicians go to, where we don't. you know, we're not thinking about the fact that we're not getting the lion's share of our masters, because we're making the money on tour, and then tour has girls and tour has the, the, the, the arena singing your song and i need you right now. did you do good, champ, you know, like uh, with floyd mayweather, um is is such a hero of mine and so excellent because he is a, a champion, right, but then also he wasn't afraid to say: i do my deals, i make my money and what i like is, you know, he didn't let the, the older system, tell him how to spend his money or how to show his money. it was up to him because he's the, he's his own king. you know, god is the king of us all, but he's his own king. and a lot of times in america we haven't seen, we haven't seen kings, we haven't seen the, the, the, the royal blood in our bone marrow and the way it comes through. now we can show it in and rap, and the way we put our chains on, the way we dress, we can show them the way we play ball and things like that. but it's another frontier to being, to being a king. well, there's also something where you feel diminished in the fact that you know that your money is being stolen by people that don't deserve it. so if you have some record executives, if you have some people that you know have looped you into a [ __ ] up deal and they're making millions while you're making thousands, that [ __ ] with your head, yeah, it just does. it makes you worry, makes you stress, gives you exactly anxiety. did he touch you? it could drive you crazy. yeah, it could drive you crazy, yeah, yeah. so i still don't understand how they talked you into medication. man, i wish i knew you better back then, because, uh, i would have just had you exercise. i would idea i would say: so what? whatever he's doing, you can't do like. you have to understand that different people have different amounts of energy. they have you. you have this ability to to have these like really all-encompassing thoughts, where you have these long trains of ideas and thoughts in your head and you're implementing them. this is all good. this is. this is a powerful thing. i don't think it's a negative thing at all. i mean, some of it comes to you know i'm dealing with issues that are not just you know, black and racial issues. i'm dealing with, uh, maverick. you know innovator issues, yeah, i'm dealing with. you know just as many, uh, you know issues where there's walls of, you know invisible walls and invisible chains. as you know, michael jackson dealt with as a black musician or urban musician, where he had to go and, um, urban, he came with thriller. he's like let me go get this person who directed, which is the eastwick, to, i'm gonna get a movie director and he changed, you know, uh, movies forever. i'm dealing with some, um, some walls that you know people have done to hold back, uh, agents of change throughout history. you know it's like the movie is here, like this part you know us talking right now may be a scene from my life's movie: uh, like tesla was, you know, a, a white guy that was a ladies man and he would be going to all the like fancy events and everything, and like he stopped having sex at age 40. yeah, and said, you know, i'm going to focus on it- and and i mean he died. he died penniless at the end. you know i'm not gonna say like he turned evil but he's trying to sell a bomb and he had all these like answers, uh, that would change the construct of society. and, like, my best example is, like kodak is there in a place where they can barely pull it together now, but they invented the digital camera and they didn't bring it to market because, um, because, um, they had all this film to sell. well, one of the things that's really, you know, that's a challenge for me is: you know, i've i designed this thing, this, we call it the foam runner, and we built a factory for it and cody, and you can make these, uh, in 25 minutes. and what i'm saying about design, i was talking to one of the just awesome designers that we just uh, uh, got over yeezy. we got like this amazing crew. we got guys that nike sued us for, and one of these guys i was trying to hire him for two years. he had to, he had an encounter, he had to go surf for a year and now he's in and when he, like you know, does is um, is a cad drawings. it's almost like one shot, one kill. you know, sometimes you design stuff, you got to do it like five, eight times. like his first one is so close to being ready to go to market because he sketches in a certain kind of way and for the longest we said: you know, let's um, uh, i've been saying i want to get rid of laces and we still have shoes we sell with laces because it's a popular shoe and people love this shoe and it it hurts me. i feel like steve jobs trying to like remove buttons off the side of the next apple. and one of the things that's interesting about this: if you look at most sneakers, if you look at you guys sneakers right now, you have a tongue, you know, and it it goes this direction. this is one of the innovations about this is one reason why this is one of the most important sneaker designs is this goes this way because it's ergonomic and i remember putting it on and being uncomfortable with wearing it because i'm so used to like the way like a jordan or something fits with my jeans, and i remember talking to kobe and him talking about having to make sneakers that fit with jeans and that was a big thing because you know that's what we grow up, we go. you know, coconut jeans and jordans or something like that. so, um, this also. i feel that just the process when i design, i become like a three-year-old. i have to go to my gut. i have to forget everything i know and really focus in to what i feel, like some straight jedi yoda or like. you know, if i could grab that water bottle like, like, wouldn't it have been cool if i just did it right now? i should have had a magnet on there that you feel like he'd be like yo, this dude's a wizard, um, so, so. so for me, you know, i i'm gonna make this shoe be twenty dollars, and you know money isn't real, so that means the world should be eventually free. so i'm gonna manifest the world being free. my dad, he lives in a dr and he says: you know, anything that you put in the ground grows. so why do people still go hungry? and i like that in theory, but i was like man, farming is really hard, though, man, i think you know i might go hungry if i have someone to farm this food, it's like. but you know, back in the days we we had that skill set. now we're losing these skill sets that actually we can sustain off of uh. so with this uh- and i- i love giving you guys my riffs- i'm like a human version of instagram. when you look at instagram. you look at, you know, you're looking like a hundred images a day. uh, well, i've got millions of images in my mind and the majority of them haven't been realized yet. you know there's some images that are from my memory, but i got this whole the future that's in my mind. that has to be brought. so this is. you know, you talk about hype culture and shoes being sold on the. you know the resale market and yeezy lives in that place, but i, i, you know, i don't like the idea. i don't love the idea that some of the reason why people buy it is just, uh, for hype culture, or you ain't got this, or i got this colorway and you don't have it. that type of mentality i mean it's. i'm an essentialist, i'm a, i'm a minimalist and like i, i, i have to. i will bring the the fully a to z our existence version to existence. like victor gruen designed the shopping centers, but he designed full utopian communities and people were like, oh, we're just cool with the shopping center, that's all we want, and these ideas that he had never got brought into fruition, a little bit like disney kind of based epcot center on, like on victor gruen, but these, this next frontier of these communities and villages of happiness are way closer to a kenyan village than it is to like a gated community, uh, village. but one of the things about your this aversion to hype culture. one of the good things about the hype culture is, if people get into your products, they're going to get into you and they're going to get into your ideas and all these ideas that you have will become a part of their thought process. they'll start thinking about it. they go, hey, he's got some great points. if people really get into your [ __ ], they're also really going to get into your ideas. i think it's one of the things that make people uncomfortable about you is you have the courage to have all these bold ideas and to implement them and to do all these different things. that bothers people, and there's a lot of people that don't have that kind of courage and they are straddled down by anxiety and they see a guy like you and they like try to find flaws, they try to find things that are wrong with it. instead of looking at the positive aspects of it, they'll only concentrate on the negative aspects of it. i don't think i don't see it that way. i've never saw it that way. i look, you, look at that guy [ __ ]. do anything. there's people like tesla and there's people who you know. there's a person who killed animals with tesla cords to make people not like tesla. yeah, the personal citizen, yeah. person who made the electric chair be made with the tesla courts for so people wouldn't like tesla. tesla still has inventions that haven't been brought to our society. that would have brought more simplicity and happiness to our society, like the westinghouse ability to transmit electricity through the air, which is fascinating. i don't know if that would have worked in today's world with cell phones and all the different electronics and even, you know, modern air travel. i don't know. i don't know what it would have worked, but things would have been different. people are over designing into industries where they see they can make some money, as opposed to stepping back and saying: how do we look at the entire earth as an opportunity to free everyone and create happiness for for everyone? so like only a, b? there's only a billion people on the internet. you never think about that. there's seven to eight billion people on the on earth, but then there's only a billion people that are influenced and that are on the internet. we feel like the internet is everything. it's only like 15, you know, 16, 18 of human beings. but in order to make for our civilization, for us to survive, we have to make more human beings. we have, we have family, we have, we have to have food, we have to have shelter. that we don't have to have the internet, we don't have to have music, we don't have to have. you know, that's a conversation, i mean. i mean, i mean it enhances life. yeah, it enhances the quality of life is better. but look at the music, look, look at, look at what the information where we're, we're, uh, we're putting in it. like i feel bad when i hear, uh, rap songs. i feel bad. even the stuff that you know, i just recently put out i was like you know how you listen to lames, they the imitation man, like why is that's just? i don't like that message because we're all the imitation of our parents and imitation of this invitation and then imitation of adam and eve. you know, we're and we're, uh, we're all the next versions there should be the v2, v3, v4. like you know, michelangelo and da vinci had the same teacher. you know, there's times where you know my like, uh, people work with me or just say, like my mentees or whatever will go out and they'll do something, uh, that i wanted to do. and then i'm, i'm torn because as a man, you know, i'm, i'm, i'm jealous and i'm proud at the same time. and it's like a father-son relationship, because sometimes, when the, when the sun goes out and is more successful at things, the father wants to say that's a good job. but every time the son does something that's a good job, it reminds the father of his failures. yes, so it's just. i mean, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a strong dynamic. that that's where i have to lean on god to not be like you know this, uh, this like uh prick that's jealous of. you know people who are innovating or taking you know the, the goal line, because we got to realize we're in a relay race of humanity at a certain point. whoever you know what, what, what the inventors in the in the past did, is now handed over to the inventors today. they're handed over to the next vendors. well, the good thing about the walls and the perception and all that is this: like smaller barrier to entry allows there to be, you know, a walt disney and a steve jobs and a henry ford. so what i'm doing right now there's a. there's a. there's a real barrier to entry to doing constructing homes and communities and farms like you can't. you can't just do it, like how you can. just, you know it's hard for someone to go from. i'm not saying it can't happen, i'm just saying that it's difficult for someone to go from, you know, programming and putting their music out on the internet today to what it was that michael jackson had to do. that very entry was so hard for him that i mean, since he, this guy, was the leader of the jackson five when he was five, like his entire life led up, and this is what he focused on and it made and it was all focused on that, so it made the great michael jackson. now i want to do this comparison of disney, uh steve and uh, uh henry ford. and what yeezy is? it's really hard to make houses. it's a. it's like a corrupt uh industry. also, you got contra. how many times have you started on a house and uh contractors like start over charging for stuff and the budget ends up being twice the amount and it's twice as long. look if you had a relationship. that's why relationships are a better currency than uh, than um, than money. if you had a relationship with the contractors, if you were part of their family, your house would be done quick. i feel like it's a practical joke on rich people how long houses take to build. i was in the airport and there was a first class line that was super slow and there was a coach area with like eight openings and there was no one in it. and then i hopped out and this other gentleman hopped out with me and went through that line and we went through. but the rich people with the hermes belts didn't want to lose their position so bad that they would rather wait in the first class line than to have the time back and go through that. now this gentleman is a surgeon that works on people's hearts through their feet, so it's like that kind of engineer, serger, doctor mentality. he's like, yeah, i got money because this, this is what i'm doing, but i'm here to serve and i have a mentality that i'm not better than the person that's in coach, which is the reason why we were the only two that went through. uh, that, how do you segue off of this when i just go into this. like, how do you even find a question? what are you thinking over there right now? there's no goodness. yeah, yeah, there's no reason to worry about it. yeah, you, you have this thought. do you have a rigid process that you organize your day with? like, how do you? you, you seem to have so many different thoughts and so many different things going on simultaneously. like, how do you, how do you organize your day? do you have like ritual? do you have? yes, i uh drive my children to school. i drive my kids to school and i stay at school with them all day. and you know, i'm in the kitchen like, uh, working with the top chefs on the planet to create this, you know, these healthy menus, and i'm working with the farmer. so the school that i'm at is also, um, it's like this, new. i don't wanna- no disrespect to nasa, i was gonna say new nasa, but um of humanity that we're anchoring it around, uh, our children. so that's what my day consists of. but then i also, uh, in the past couple months, have been going to atlanta for two days a week, or three days a week, uh, because i'm building this uh, 120 000, uh, oh, i'm not supposed to say that i'm building. we're building a sound stage, but um and but. it was funny because i go back and forth on content. should i work in content? should i work in tech? i have all these like website ideas and tech ideas and i sometimes i was like i'll say i'm cursed by tech, like i'm not. you know, i don't have any curses, um, or god has, lets me break the curses and break the chains. i rather say i i don't know if content is my calling, like messaging, like let me show you what a school of the future looks like. let me show you a monasteries of the future. let me show you the farms of the future look like. but we're 20 years past the future, like it's in 2020, like we're supposed to be in the future by 2000. so it's my job to pull the future into now. and that's something i struggle with when i talk about the different things that i'm doing: getting into the idea of doing like content for netflix or content for hulu and like what that content? because i believe we're in the movie, i believe we're in the game, we're in like grand theft auto. it's just too many things that align and we're not. we can terraform. what we can do is be like if your grand theft auto character just started redesigning the world himself, like painting his own, his own world. we have this opportunity to make life as fun as these second lives. but if you look at how politics just general unhappiness, misery, control the speed, that contractors go, the farmers that wouldn't finish the farm. the way we are with each other is why people feel like, look, everyone's going to go into, like this ready player. one second life, and i believe that our first life can be just as a imaginative uh, and it will be. so that's my, and i have a bunch of friends that work in the gaming industry and i have friends that work in the content industry and i'm saying i'm anchoring on real life to make real life as awesome as games, to make real life as awesome as, uh, movies. so did i answer the question of my schedule every day? yeah, but i mean you. so you just basically go on what you feel like working on you. you basically just start your day, you, you do your stuff with your kids and then, whatever these ideas you have, you just nourish them, you just encourage them, you just you just feed whatever thoughts are in your head. well, yeah, but what i was expressing on that, on that last um symphony i gave you, was uh, this, uh was um, that i do have this challenge. that's where i'm designing. i'm just, i'm actually designing what i'm doing with my time saying [Music]. should i be even taking a meeting? like when i take a meeting, this i know if it's a good or bad meeting. if someone's talking to me and i just get sleepy, i know that that's not what i should do. but if someone's talking, i'm, you know, energized. i like saying the word energize over the word excited, because this is what they do to, this is what they do to all of us. they get us excited, excited and anxiety. they kind of go together like someone can say, hey, i got you a new car, um, and it's across the street. you get so excited, you run across the street, get hit by a car trying to run to your new. but if you're energized about having the car, perhaps you look both ways. see, i played this dictionary game with the like this: uh, um, this small webster pocket dictionary, and we'll go to a page and say go to page with the word help on it and we say: highlight all the words you think are positive and then we talk about afterwards why do you think that's positive? so the word help is like, it's like a uh, it's like a bad leg on a table. you think you could stand on it, but if you stand right there that table could flip over. the fourth definition in the word help is to ignore, and it actually makes sense, you know, oh, like, if you have a meeting right- here's the answer- when you know the meeting didn't go do good, uh, after it didn't go well, the person says it. then, oh, how can i help? that means they don't want to do nothing. let me just give you a phone number, right, you know, the word is to ensure. and then there's a lot of words that end with ure, that are very powerful: future, sure, pure, endure and um, that that goes into like the rhyme, because i'm literally trying to figure out the video game at all times and see where these things uh parallel. i know this can get into like a riff where people like, okay, yeah, you're losing what you're saying right now, but, um, but look at that, look at the dictionary, look at these words. i have friends, uh, that uh, english is their second or third or eighth language and they say that english is the hardest language to learn because there's so many words to uh, to, that mean the same thing, it it like it tears me to my core that my daughter has to learn two, the difference between two t-o-o and t-o. i wanna just be like just draw the number two, like, just make it like. sometimes, i don't know when, you know the difference, i'm like a terrible speller and i believe that there's like curriculums that are that are european curriculums that don't even apply to our genes. you know who we are as a people, like african descent people, we don't even talk like that, like this is a skill set, but i'm still talking white. basically, like you'll see, like a black pastor. you know, give this amazing. like sermon, or like marry someone. i was at a wedding and this guy, they said, wow, he speaks so well. well, what do you mean? well, he speaks super white, like, yeah, that's what the definition of well, right, right, it's just sounds that you use and to communicate ideas, right, yeah? well, it's funny. i bumped it to a friend of mine. um, i actually met williams. i said, uh, givenchy, i wasn't expecting to see, i wasn't expecting. i mean expecting to see him. i wasn't expecting to see him and we're at the mercer lobby and he caught me off guard and i was like i didn't use words when, when i, when i, when i saw him, i like almost communicated in a different language, like a language like joy or happiness. only 30 percent of our communication is, is verbal. that's why the masks just really throw me off, because i can't tell what someone is thinking and feeling, because a lot of times, half the time, people don't say what they're thinking and feeling and i have to decode with the mask. i can only, you know, hear what they're saying. that's the problem with social media too, right, yes, things are black and white and things being taken out of context. i mean, that's the reason why people, like you know, love the show that they're like, oh, we got the yay, joe rogan. we can hear him go into all of these riffs, yeah, and we can feel him. you could see, you know how i'm looking, you can see my energy and the way i'm saying it too, yeah, so, and you see people sitting down having an actual conversation, a real conversation, yeah, and and a conversation where anybody that comes on this show you don't have like this, like sometimes with reporters. they have like people that are media, they have like a complex. you don't have a complex, you're like yo- let's first off to get this straight- like if i like i could whip your ass. i'm joe rogan, i'm a professional fighter. now let's start the conversation, which i think is another reason. like with nick cannon, he's like man. i married mariah carey, i did all these and both of these interviews have been very positive, because people aren't carrying something already, like some form of chip on their shoulder where they gotta like atta every sentence. sometimes i talk to reporters, it's like they're saying the thing they wanted to say to this guy in high school that they never got to complete the conversation and they're taking it out on me. i'm like, yeah, i think there's a lot of people that have conversations with people and they want to create a viral moment too that it's not just a conversation. they, they have an agenda, it's. it's almost like you were talking about the disney star wars movies. that then it's not a work of art, it's, it's a formula, like two plus two is four. let's put those together, we'll make some money. instead of the original star wars, which was the hero's journey, which was like a joseph campbell book. it's just like there was a beauty and a purity to it. it's a, it's an expression, like someone comes up with an idea and they bring it to fruition. and then you get to watch and you're like, wow, it moves you. the new movies don't move you. and it was a crew of of um of leaders, of thought leaders that, like i, was a. is it brian de palma that told george to put the words at the beginning? because it's like you, really, i all i've been feeling like is like, when i talk up to this point, i just been making thx, you know, and then the toys from star wars have not come out first, which would be like, you know, like the yeezys or something like that. and now some making the whole star wars in real life like backwards, like the product came first, kind of like disney, like disney he was. mickey mouse became super popular before he was able to get all of his imagineers- uh, imagineers- in. i want to point out, you know, when people talk about being, you know, self-absorbed or the center of your own universe. um, what's the main character in star wars name? luke skywalker, who created star wars? george lucas, oh, but did he write it. but listen to that last name. yeah, that's, yeah, george luke. yes, yeah, he's the main character in star wars. he gets this esther and it was awesome. yeah, there's, there's something about, uh, things that are pure, right, versus things that are attempting to recreate something that people are going to like. there's, there's a difference, and it's it's in music as well. right, like your, your music resonates with people because it's obviously coming from your mind, whereas some people are creating songs that they think are going to be hits, they're creating top 40. it's coming from my heart and my gut, but when it's the most pure, it's coming from god and i'm being used as a channel. it's like when tanya harden hit the, the triple flip, you know she had all that skill- and then at some point it's not called a trip- i'm about to say trippy, triple lindy, like is rajiv or rodney dangerfield or something. but it's like there's these moments where we do things that are seem like superhero level, and i think that's what m knight shalamon was laying out for us with unbreakable uh glass, and what was the other one with the guy with the multiple personalities, just like he's got three of these films that are like showing us. hey, you're superheroes, you can believe it. the greatest disabler of our, of, of our abilities, our greatest, our greatest kryptonite is doubt. right, you know fear, yeah, doubt like, why did i, um, you know, um, like going to? why did i register so late, uh, to run for president covet? i like i remember like i i had, uh, i had the virus and i was sitting, you know, quarantined in my house and my cousin text me about being prepared to run for president and i just completely pull like put it off to the side because i was like shivering and you know, having the shakes and taking hot showers and eating soup and, you know, just sleeping. i don't think it was that bad, i think it was a mild case, um, and it just threw off. i mean, it threw everyone off, it threw everybody's plans off, and then, you know, it was just this calling on my heart. and i remember talking to like really like elitist, um, uh, you know, writers- you know i was trying to avoid saying white supremacists- but like elite, like the, the, the liberal elites are like you know. so, boy, who you gonna vote on, you know, like, who are you to run for office and why would you sign up for office. you know, uh, if you, if you can't even get on ballots, that's, people are saying that to me and i could get on the ballot. it's like there's black mothers that go into hospital and the doctor will tell them that there's something wrong with their child. to get them to this is happening, uh, to this date. and then when people say, you know, are you, are you a pawn? like for the republicans? the reason why i think that people are asking me, that is because the because the democrats do create black pawns. they do have celebrities that they'll sit down and meet with and say: you're going to be an advocate for the democratic party and you know, everyone's like. you know- and i'm not trying to take any sides of, like republicans or democrats, i'm just saying why, where, why were people so much thinking that i was like, uh, a form of, uh, a pawn? and then the idea that you know, liberals would say, like, the funny thing is, liberals, i think, uh, and i'm, i'm- i don't know if i could classify myself as liberal, but i'm, i'm definitely kind of liberal elite. i wrote my beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy like i've had some of the best writing, so that would put me in that class, so to say. but i'm also just a purist. like i see a kenyan home and be like that's beautiful, right there. i'm not, like i gotta have the. so the one of the most racist things that liberals who pride themselves on not being racist have said to me is: like: uh, you're gonna split the black vote and that makes it seem like black people can't make decisions for ourselves. and that, don't know, white people know me like i'm like only the liberal. they literally make it saying like only black people will vote for me. right, think about that statement, the, the nuance of institutionalized racism, and this would be like somebody from the art world, you know. i mean they just have a place where no one has really been able to embrace the idea of blacks not being in a block and staying in one place, right, or blacks having a devote democrat. yeah, or blacks have an opinion, like us not being on boards or us being like handlers for other black people, meaning like if we work at a label or we work at a big corporation, it's our job to go talk to the other black people, you know, to calm other black people down, but we're working for, you know, uh, universal or vivendi or uh, whatever the organizations were. you know, i was thinking about buying my masters and i realized that that was too small of a thought. i'm gonna buy universal. they're only a 33 billion organization. i'm one of the greatest product producers that ever existed. i'm, i'm and i'm a child. i'm 43 years old- i was 53 million dollars in debt, uh, uh. you know, four years ago- and now it's proven that i'm the new michael jordan of products- i went to adidas and we were a 15 billion organization, losing 2 billion. before kova hit. our market cap was 68 billion. i went to the gap and are partnered with the gap and our stock jumped 45 in two hours. the organization made two billion dollars and two out in two hours, and now we've doubled. we, i mean, the gap was, uh, mark cap was lower than yeezy. it was like three billion dollars when, when, when, i first got there. now it's like seven, eight billion dollars and we haven't even released the product yet. but what i loved, i, you know. i sat there and i did the deal without getting on the board and i looked at my cousin and i and i- i didn't want to sign the deal without being on the board- and i looked at him and said: i'm doing this for you, meaning like, this is part of a relay race. it would just be a given that if someone of color was to your position, my position of influence would be on the board. but michael jordan had to break down walls and michael jackson had to break down walls for us to break down the next walls, and the next walls are the boardroom. because you know what the boardroom is. it's an opinion. see, people are fine for us to play basketball and you know rap and make clothes, but the the society is set up is not really used to refine, with us actually having an opinion. and i can understand why. because what is our opinion based on if we grew up thinking we were slaves, if our opinion isn't based on: hey, my dad taught me how to run this company. you know, my dad is smarter than me and everything he wanted to do, black people thought he was crazy and he had to do it with white people who thought he was incompetent because he was black. and the way these companies and the way, uh, the music industry, the way managers and the way society generally looks at, uh, black people is the way like a misogynistic man looks at a hot lady. what can you give me, what can you do for me? no one, a misogynistic man not gonna look at a hot lady and say: can you run my company? so you know, this idea of me, you know, and i, i i got, like you know, i'm building my factories. i've just simplified the design and i was working with a guy that, uh, you know, um, that's helping me to, you know, build some of the factories. it was an older white gentleman and he just matter-of-factly says we're sitting at his house, uh, in malibu, it's a nice day. he's just matter of fact. he says: adidas will never put you on the board and i'm like this, this wall has to come down. like, how could you not have the guy that has the best idea? so one of the great things with universal, one of the approaches that we have, is, you know, universal. when jimmy iveen and dr dre sold beats by dre, uh, universal had a chance to buy in or do different things. they sold it for three billion dollars- that was half of the value of universal at that time- of six billion. due to the internet, which the music industry was afraid of in 2000, universal now, i think is a worth 33 bill, 35 billion dollars, um, and now they have another steve jobs- you know howard hughes, henry iv, disney, elon kind of character within their midst. but they're so concerned about the control of the idea of artists because they're using me as, like this artist that has attracted other artists, it also i use them. i got famous, i made some money, i got to tour, you know, i became this superstar, so we use each other. now this is just an adjustment that needs to be made in the relationship and i can make, and i will make, products that will make more money than universal is worth. but it's not about the money. as i said earlier, it's about the fact that, even though my net worth is five billion dollars and i'm one of the most famous, most influential god-fearing christians on the planet, the i still have to go to this man or this organization and ask him for something. and that is what it's about. you can have a company right when you go and do your companies. don't think, because you got the most ownership, that you actually have the control. if you don't have the information and the knowledge of how the distribution works and you're not having that conversation, you don't have the control. so what i did in my organization with universal, with gap and with adidas, i told my lawyers, my managers, everything. no one can communicate with these organizations except for me. you can give me advice, but they gotta talk to the boss, which is me, and right there you start to get the information flow. i guess who's my cfo? who me? so that means i do have the time. i do 10 to 15 transactions. what i do is i pay because i had open credit cards, i had checks, you know, i had people flying in and out, i had a consultant agreements, like people who weren't on the salary but they were consultants. i had, you know, uh, people paying for flights, hotels, cars, food, netflix, like everything, just running the account. just even right now, i cancel all my credit cards except for one credit card. this is like the oprah winfrey moment, where she's like man. when i started spending cash, i was like i really realized you know how much i was spending and i signed all my own checks. and the thing that happens in the music industry, uh is- and just a lot of industries- like people tell you that someone needs to do something for you and it's like: look this siri do everything, for you know you can do, it's possible. and it's just when you ask me, how do i delegate my time, it's important for me to delegate my time. if i made 210 million dollars last year and, yeah, i have a lot of maverick ideas, i'm working on cities and homeless shelters and farms and i'm reinvesting myself. so a lot of mavericks will, you know, spend their money on their ideas and they'll invest in what they see the future is. and i ended up with a net worth of 10 million. i remember, you know, a few a month ago, people were like you can't show your taxes because people won't understand that you're a billionaire if they see that you only netted 10 million last year and after the gap deal happened, my net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion and i had been asking the people around me to run the story and they were going to run it with bloomberg. they never ran it. i was not afraid of people looking at me like i was not a billionaire and i said: be honest, show my taxes, show every, everything. and then the reports came back: oh, you're worth 5 billion. it came from me just being honest when i want to say something about the gap deal also and specifically the name the gap. in my and my journey with that, like at age 16 i worked at the gap- i always saw the gap as like being the apple of apparel. i always had this comparison with siege. i always felt like i was the steve jobs of the gap. it was something about how clean it was and what mickey drexler had done all these commercials. and, like you know, at age 16 i was, uh, working at the gap and i got fired for stealing and i was actually stealing khakis. i was stealing khakis from my friend. funny thing: look, i stole khakis for my friend. when i started doing music at age 19, 18, i went and bought a chain. i came home one day didn't see where the chain was. come to find out my friend was smoking crack and it stole my chain. so the guy i was stealing for end up stealing from me. um but um, it's khakis. i was stealing some gap khakis. i wanted those khakis. that bad um. so then, 27 years later, you know, i give my life to god and i start doing sunday service. one of the things that i had to do for sunday service- or i got to do that was fun for me to do was to design the wardrobe for sunday service and we would redesign t-shirts and it says in the bible that jesus wore a seamless garment. so we started building t-shirts where the scene was only here, or only two seams on the shirt, or moving it around and what the neck was. and i made t-shirt after t-shirt after t-shirt, and christianity we said we stand in the gap, so watch this. this opportunity is presented. and i always had clothes that were kind of chill, like they could be at the gap, they were not overly fashionable. and god said you, you, you stood in the gap and i'm gonna have you stand in the gap for real and i'm gonna give you favor and increase. and i know per some person, i know somebody where all that design and t-shirts will come in handy. i literally was designing t-shirts for sunday service, like david working out in the field tending to the field. you know, when goliath came, uh, they wanted one of his brothers and the warriors to to go up against goliath and his father chose david and david said: i don't need all this armor, i just need these three smooth stones, i just need. you know, this is how i got to see. they didn't know, david had had to fight a lion and had to fight a, a bear. so, god, by him tending to the fill in humility and in service to god and honor to his family, he was able to have the skill set to take down goliath. we hit the street. you know it's a term that i had to learn- wall street. we hit the street like you never, ever, saw it before. i used to be in san fran asking people to invest in me. nobody invested me. when i went to a wedding in san fran with all these billionaires and investors- angel investors- you should have seen people's faces. they were like you jumped from the three-point line. you ran a stock by 45 percent. you see, think about this. you're gonna split the black vote. you can't vote for that. you. you're only a rapper, you're only. it's like all these things that diminish me, yeah, and now it's like deadpool, like i came back as like a superhero, and i won't let that be the kryptonite. i won't let my own ego be my kryptonite. i won't let other people's opinions be my kryptonite. i won't let these labels that people put on me be my kryptonite, and a lot of times i don't like to watch these interviews back until about, you know, three, four, five years later, because i'm always, you know, i'm visiting the now. i'm existing in the future and visiting the now when i'm speaking to you and they make a lot more sense in the future because i can tell you. but he can show you, god can show you. so a lot of stuff i'm telling you and some people are following me. some people are believing in it and some people are just doubting it because they want to put this label. oh, he's crazy, or it's just a black guy saying it, or it's just a rapper, it's just a, it's just an entertainer, it's just whatever it is. so i can say the most wild ideas out loud. it's like veronica corningstone wanting to be an anchor person, and i remember she said: so, ron, i told you i wanted to be a. he said, yes, i heard you, i wrote it down. veronica corningston had a very funny joke tonight and every time i talk it's literally like veronica cornerstone having a very funny joke tonight, like when i said i was gonna run for president. that was like: okay, go ahead. would you like to interject? do you have thoughts and ideas also that you'd like to have be a part of your interview. well, you went from. you went from people mad at you that you split in the back black vote all the way to the gap and all the way to veronica. i made it, but then i brought it back- yes, you did- to the vote to run it, for you brought it back from to people doubting you and people putting limitations on you. people are tuning in this podcast to go on the journey with us. yeah, listen, they do or they don't, it's up to them. yeah, but do you know? the beautiful thing is, you're not listening to these people, these people that are trying to put these labels on you and tell you what to do, and you're not saddled down by fear, you're not settled down by doubt. you're, you're willing to take these chances. if you did become president, what would you do? that was different. i mean pretty much everything. i was just looking at the suits last night. i was like yo [Laughter], what would you redesign? i don't wear white anymore. they had a white shirt, you know they had like a i just, um, i would, i would redesign this. i, i will. and it's not a wood, right, it's not a. if it's not a, if it's just when, right, um, we got to start with the budget. i feel like you know the fact that i went from being in debt to uh to uh being. i don't even like the way it sounds, the multi-billion, because we think about steve jobs. money is like the least of what's awesome about him, and the money is just a tool, like it's like nails, like i got the most names. you feel like it's scored on the scoreboard, though it proves. it proves not just value, but it proves effectiveness, yeah, and it's like you're crazy to your right, so it proves, in some way, that a lot of the things i said that were crazy i was actually right about. yeah, looking at that budget, and i think that that's part of god's like training. like mr miyagi, paint defense. you know karate kid daniel son i on that, i gave like the full description of the uh, of the analogy, just in case, uh, people didn't. um, what do you think you would do, though, if they come to you with talks about foreign policy? people love talking about foreign policy. that's the number one uh question. yeah, but when i talk about the budget, you know this: paint the fence, the fact that i had to. you know that i have to understand 300 million dollars of cash a year that you don't get trained for that. that's like astronaut training, that i have to understand how to have multiple industries, that i have to understand how to build and house and provide. you know, i i provide people with health care and i could. i had this idea of doing a zero employee org where i i put everything on my partners, on universal, on the gap, on adidas, but i believe this is amazing training for me as a a black person. there's people who who have been raised to respect a penny, but as a black person, i've been raised to look down at a penny. but the people who really hold their money respect every penny. they respect the money. and it's interesting, i had an argument with uh, one of my managers because i made my own travel ban in my organization, because you know i did when i did sunday service a month and a half ago. it was 25 flights coming in and people i didn't know because there's criminals in my organization trying to kill bob marley, not to jfk or mlk me but deplete my resources. so i created this travel. explain that. what do you mean by that? what i mean by criminals in your organization? like what do you mean meaning? there's people that, okay, i fired this one cfo about three months ago and up to a week ago he still had an open credit card because i, i'm gonna dig lower and dick lower and go to it. it's like always like, is this the new person that's in charge of your money? it's like, no, i'm the new person that's in charge of your money, that's in charge of my money, rather so. so that's why you became your cfo, that's why i became, and it's it's the best and it's it clears my thoughts and it really helps me with design. it helps me as i'm designing uh, uh, designing, uh, what i'm doing at the gap. it helps me when i'm how i'm designing the curriculum. it helps me in the way i'm designing the kitchen, the way i'm delegating, the way i'm working, the way i'm and being a better leader, being a better uh, being a better listener. wait a second, but there was some question you had. i had, i was answering and i gave it all. before you went to foreign policies, i went to the, the budget. well, i said it's like danielson painting the fence, the fact that i've had to really look at and understand that kind of money and this god-given anointing, being a producer, being a head of industry, to be a fearing and god and a servant of god, and a producer and head of industry at the same time- is literally like the perfect combination for a president and, to be honest, i'm literally like, every now and then, america has to get. america deserves the world deserves a leader that they can 100 percent trust, that, whatever i'm saying to you, with the information that i have in front of me, i 100 believe that, like when i talked to the? uh, when i was with the president of haiti and he gave us an island- me and shervin pisivar that was an early angel investor at uber and is working on the? uh, the virgin hyperloop right now- a really great friend of mine. he saved me. he's had me avoid deals where i was gonna give up a percentage of my company for a third of the value and different things like that. so, uh, we go to haiti and the president, uh, uh, gives us this island to develop, uh, to make a city of the future, and also we're gonna have the farmers and the people who live there take a percentage, i mean, take ownership of the land that they have right now, so when it raises in value, they all eat off of uh what the idea is. but he said that um, the way that he has done uh business with our president is so straightforward. i believe that i know that me as president would be the best thing that ever happened for america's foreign policy. i've traveled more than any president already and i bring people together. i put rivals on songs together to create masterpieces. i go and i empathize when i meet with leaders in africa. when i meet with leaders in um, i didn't really have a good uh. next thing, i wanted to sound good and like naming leaders and i wanted to sound [Laughter] see, honestly. so when i, when i meet with, when i meet with leaders, i'm not trying to go in there and see how they can use my internet. i'm not trying to go in there and buy up their land and develop it and buy it up for cheap. you know we're we're going to share information. you know we're uh. you know we have a idea we just had of a dual citizenship for americans with african uh dissent uh that the ability to create environments and communities completely can change the way uh people act. you know, if people are hungry, they're gonna act a certain way. people have food, they're gonna act a certain way. people are away from their friends and family, they're gonna act a certain way. they're gonna need to. they're at a college town. they need to stop by this. you know frat party and you know drink and do the, but when they're uh, you know, but you got to go here so then you could go there and like society is all about dismantling the family. i see things being more like a kibbutz or you know where the family can be as close and when the grandparents can be next to the children and, um, you know, these ideas i have about um, how communities, uh, ca should be, are worldwide, simplified ideas and that they're not based on industry, even though i understand industry. they're based on serving god and serving families, and that's something that everyone across the globe, no matter what country in the world, whatever continental world, all of the moms and dads have something in common: they want the world to be better for their children. we all want the world to be better for the children and we can show ways that we are not at odds. think about: the world is a giant piano, but we're playing off-key. so for a producer to synthesize those ideas and not say, okay, we're gonna shut. i spent time in china. i spent a year in china when i was, uh, in fifth grade. i used to speak chinese, like new york, like i, i don't know a lot of. yeah, my mom was an english professor. they had an exchange program where a chinese student could come to america and she could go to, which was there was like chinese at that time couldn't come to america as uh, as easily. so you know there's america's greatest export is influence and culture. china actually has like imitation, paris imitation- they probably got imitation calabasas at this. they probably do. at this point, you know the. the artists define culture. that's what makes. there's the artist that made the design, the statue of liberty. there's an artist that designed the eiffel tower. this is the reason why i donated 100 million dollars to james terrell's rodent crater uh uh project when i went to. this is like the eighth wonder of the world, but i saw spaces that we can exist in. that would be helpful for our health, our well-being. these are healthier places for us to be. we need to be like almost like turalyon's, like our. our life is like a shakespearean- uh, like shakespeare has written 30 percent of, uh, our language that we use, like, i say like, he must have been a really nice person, like davinci used to walk away from people when he would talk to people and that's. but that's the reason why it's the da vinci code and at the da vinci life, because he never was able to get it across to the, to the, to the level to affect us for generations to come. these people love art, but they want to put art in the box. we need to surround ourselves with the artist, because the artists are the, the most connected, the most truthful, and their dinosaur never got killed. somehow. the people who have figured out how to make a real, a living off of art is what do you mean by the dinosaur? never got killed, meaning art class would be considered to be fun. like every kid loves to draw, yeah, right, but some people got to grow up and like the artists, right, in some way don't have to. yes, like this separate. we're all children, we're all. if you're, if you're alive, you're a child, we're all children in god's eyes, and we're all young people. like jesus is a old person, like he's, oh, like you know, like adam is old, you know, if you're alive, you're, you're young and we're like children and there's all these things, these sharp edges, these corners, these anxieties, these fears, these things put in our, our food, our diet, our diet of what we consume, right here, that turn us old and make us brittle and make us, uh, put that fear on our kids. don't you put that evil on me, ricky bobby? they put that, they put that. we put these evils on our children. we put racism on our children, we put fear on our children and the, the children are fearless. the children, it's. it's funny, it's like claudio sylvestre, one of our lead architects i worked with since, uh, age 24. he built this home in my oracle with john, with john paulson, and he has like this golf course which it's in. the acoustics are incredible, but it's this part where you can walk along. that's 20 feet high. and i said: you know, would you? you know what about the kids? what you know? you have a balcony, you have a banister or something. and he looked at me and said: they're smarter than we think. wow, and meaning like if we were never taught the missing banister theory, that we could all tightrope walk the missing banister theory. i wrote it in my book, thank you, and you're welcome that i wrote with my friend sakaya- that's actually here right now. that's uh, uh, that you were talking to earlier is, look, you could walk down a straight line without worrying about anything, uh, but you take that exact straight line and put it 20 story high. 20 stories high, you know, i'm going with it, yeah, and you remove the balconies. you're going to be so concerned about the idea of falling that it will make you fall. yep, and that's where the superpower is, in removing the fear. yes, that's a beautiful thing to say right there, and it's also probably the first sound biteable thing that i've said. the entire. all right, let me talk to you about so we're serious here. so let's talk about, like real presidential issues. let's talk about like here's, here's some things that, just when we talk about this country, here's some things that are that mean a lot to me. one: student debt. i think it's crazy. i think it's crazy that we take children when they're 17, 18 years old, we send them way to college, we make them literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and then we ask them to go out into the world and try to manage this money and and try to get a job that's going to pay them a fraction of what they owe for their education. i think it's crazy. i think we should figure out a way to absolve student debt. i think we should figure out a way to make education, at the very least, far less expensive than it is now. this is, this is a big issue for people, absolutely. i'm, i'm completely confident that i will figure out how to get america out of debt, that i have the ability once i see everything. i never make the wrong decision when i'm giving all the information. that's my, that's my skill set. anything i go into- producing- rap, homes, clothing, anything- once i'm given the right information, i apply my taste and i have the best taste on the planet. i mean quincy jones. there's a couple people that's like, okay, crazy, don't, taste might be better than mine, but if, quincy, could you imagine quincy jones as a president, i could. yeah, or uh, walt, disney, uh, steve jobs, like maybe some of these personalities are a little volatile, yeah, yeah, but that's how he gets things done. yeah, like for america to be as warming and inviting as, as, as disney world there used to be. you know this dream of you know people still have this dream of coming to them. they're coming to america like it's the america that i grew up even with, like when ronald reagan was in office. it's like he was hanging out with michael jackson and you know it's like it felt. america, plus the way the media showed things like the american dream was alive and well and even, at the same time, in in the ghetto, it was a living hell and we were being, you know, given. you know, bricks were put on the street. uh, bricks are pulled on the street doing the riots. now bricks are putting on the street in eighties, a different kind of brick and there were guns placed and the fathers were being taken out of the hood and this is all this. so don't let me say like everything was perfect doing that, um, doing that era, but the perception right now perception is more important than it's ever, than it's ever been. like, what we show, you know, it's just, i mean it's outright, it's, it's just, uh, i don't even wanna, i don't wanna, i don't know, i don't wanna dwell on it. let's keep going into what you're saying about the debt because, also, i don't have like, if you ask me about covet, i can only give you my perspective as a civilian. i don't. i'm not talking to these, the same people you know, and i also empower the geniuses. i was talking to my man, uh fred, and my boy, anthony, about crypto and bitcoin. you know the uh yesterday just to be prepped for this conversation, and not about the specifics of alternate currencies, which is like ac, which is like tesla, which is like, but the uh this, that my mind just goes on these like riffs right here. but uh, jack dorsey decentralized twitter two months before it really hit because he was talking to the bitcoin guys, and these are guys that really have a perspective on what the true liberation of america and humanity will be. these guys, a lot of the the specifically these guys, but a lot of the tech guys- were able to use the new highways, the new information highways, and create the next frontier of our existence, while the powers of our uh political system are still anchoring on electoral college, which was based around slavery, about the idea of slaves being three-fifths of man. and get this? it wasn't even created by pro slaves. three-fifths of man was created by the anti-slaves in the north as a compromise, and that basically explains the existence of black people in america to, to this day, the people that were on our side supposedly said we were three-fifths of men, the people that were on our side. the people on our side thought of us as three-fifths of man, meaning like, yeah, come work for us, but you know, you're three fifths of men sitting. you have electoral college and gerrymandering happening to this date where if you have uh uh, latinos, uh uh, blacks, other minorities, they're redrawing the lines to affect the vote to this day. that does not relate to the information highway that we live in today, that allow all these you know tech guys to become multi-billionaires and lead uh and and and and lead free thought, or allow you know, as best as we could, a version of free thought. i, i know i gave you a symphony, but you see how all this really connects. we're sticking. you know why don't we just keep? why don't we, why don't we put the white wigs back on? they still wear the white wigs down. uh, yeah, england, they still wear it. you know, that's the whole thing. just because you know someone's not, you know, wearing uh, uh, uh, a kkk uh uniform or a white wig doesn't mean that they aren't holding on to the very core of the, the country being uh, you know, uh, based on and built off of slavery. so when everyone's saying vote, you know, that's the reason why my mercy is vote kanye. because, like, vote for who? look man, if you ain't gonna say who you voting on out loud, don't even wear the vote t-shirt. that's so random, right, that's so rare, and we always know voters like democrat and stuff, because there's nobody. is that trump, that's like, wears a vote t-shirt. isn't that funny. but it's such a go ahead if you do say that, yeah, you say vote is mostly vote democrat, like, and if you have an american flag, mostly you're voting trump like these are. these are realities that we've sort of accepted and it's subs, it's all this subliminal stuff that's that's based on, like fear and control, even like this, like this. look at this the whole. this is the three-fifths of man thing. right, okay, the democrats were willing to take the chance of not winning as long as the conglomerate could be completely in control of as completely in control. you know what i'm saying? that bernie, yeah, bernie would have won, he would have won. this is something i wore a trumpet. i'm saying, like bernie is a superhero, yeah, you know, and he would be the perfect, the perfect and the perfect person to be the opposite of what trump represents. yeah, he's an anti-capitalist, he's a is a guy who's a social democrat and you and, but you know the problem, they couldn't control bernie because you can't- you can't control him. he's been so consistent in his whole life. so, so what i'm saying is they literally kicked if this doesn't say something. it's like they kicked the superhero, you know, saying they they. well, they wanted control. it's the same thing they did with tulsi gabbard. but bernie was interesting because he's this democratic socialist, because he's got these ideas that are scary to capitalism. you know, it's funny because i, i created the birthday party which, on the, on the next selection, what's going to happen is: i mean, you guys got 300 million viewers. you know, after this it'll probably be 900 million, because you know i run a stock up. you know, you just do a little bit of bill cosby in that neck, the uh, no doubt jello pudding, exactly exactly so, uh. so this is a long rant, but i really would like to talk to you about specific things. okay, i mean, it was a beautiful long symphony, but there's a, there's a cap on it, there's a pop. we don't, we don't, we don't, we don't want to catch up, but there's a possibility that i could- um, it's actually technically possible for me to win now, which would be the best option for america? i would uh, i'm, i'm on- uh, 12 ballots and in 17 states that you could write me in on. so if people got up, people that never voted, uh, got up, registered, voted for me, they'd have to take it, take it to the house because i would you know, i could possibly win. now i'm definitely 100 winning in 2024. and with that thought, i was like, okay, i got the birthday party, but i was thinking maybe there's a possibility i would be. they said that wouldn't happen. i was thinking i would, you know, possibly be the democrat. you know, i don't think they would ever let you in like that, but i don't know, maybe, who knows what happens after this joe biden, kamala harris thing, who knows, he knows what they think. you know some, you, i would be the first. i'm, i'm trying, i'm not trying to. i'm one of the first super famous public black free will, uh, servants of christ, uh, since modern media has come to pass, meaning, when i, when i, when i talk, i'm not talking for a conglomerate, i'm talking for myself, in service to god, that's it. that's it like i'm not, you know, i'll cover my people, cover my family, but there's not some big plan or like some practice script thing where it says: you go in and you, you say this, you, you do this, we we've got, we want to keep, uh, selling kodak film, so we want to stop, you know, you, from bringing out the digital camera. we want to keep, you know, selling this, raising the price of gas. so we're not going to look to how to like, safely harness nuclear power or to do electric power. okay, go ahead, ask another question. i really just i quite love the sound of my own voice, as you can see, apparently. uh, it's okay. so it's this microphone. we started. it sounds great. so we started with student debt and we got. we got on this long symphony, yeah, um, have you given thought into the idea of free education, and particularly here's a big one for me as well- free health care? i think, if we think of ourselves as a country and our country as a community, we're all a bunch of people that are together. if we're going to take care of things like the fire department, if we're going to take care of things like the police department, education. we've got to take care of health care we got. we got to make it so that people get sick, they don't go bankrupt. we got to make it so that no one has to worry about being taken care of. and i- i- and i don't mean to eliminate the ability for someone to hire a private specialist for surgery or anything like that. i'm not. i'm not saying that, but i'm saying at the very least, we have to cover base medical concerns for the population. it's just, it's an, a giant part of what what it is to be a person is to to worry about your your body being broken, to worry about being sick, to worry about what this is going to cost your family financially and how it could ruin people. this is a. i mean, this is a huge issue in our country- is medical health. so have you thought about that? absolutely, i, i hear you and i feel you and i feel what people are going through. i think that there is a. it's not just how we treat people. there's preventative measures. yes, that can help us from getting sick. our, our diet, our, our locations are our, the our, our jobs. there's a lot of that that affects us and puts us in those uh situation transportation you know like as you go into like autonomous uh vehicles and tram systems, like just kind of you know, trains that are like uh floating malls or floating uh starbucks or something like movement, like designing our world to be the world of the future, will uh will help us with health. that's the preventative message. and then, as far as uh being more inventive in the way we um we connect uh holistic uh medicine with modern medicine. i believe in both medicines. i believe in god, i believe in god and nature, i believe in uh science and physics and you know, it's like the first, simplest form of bioengineering uh, i think, is farming and to be able to have like i talk about the, the guys at mit, the greatest scientists in the world. there's people who are that are like the elons of the the medical field, but perhaps they're sitting there on the on on the floors like serving on the front line fighting covet uh, where you know they didn't have the opportunity to create paypal and become a billionaire and go to the next idea, or when they present it and want people to invest in these inventions that they have, they haven't had the voice of the platform to bring this invention. there's cures to things like. one of the things is the silver bullet. like what? what? i went through with the medication when they gave me the medication that made me fat, but then they said, okay, we have one that doesn't we. we all know what a silver bullet is in medication, right? so it's the um. it's a medication that goes and just kills exactly what it's supposed to kill. but for capitalism that's not the best medication to actually cure people. capitalists want to keep people. they want to treat them. they want to treat, they want to keep you sick because that's how you you keep making money. to have a guy like for me. when i say i put my life on the line, i think about abraham lincoln, i think about jfk. to go in and sit and say: you know, the whole thing is no, everyone is going to be more prosperous, i think, is the word not specifically, are you going to 5x your money. everyone's like trying to get. no, it's about prosperity and to be able to really have real conversations with the lead heads of, like big pharm, and real conversations with the heads of uh, of, of, uh, holistic and and natural healing. to put these people in a room together people aren't even having. they're mad at each other, they're afraid of each other. uh, i, i i donated to a christian school in cody and um. i also went by and saw this other amazing school in uh in cody where they have uh autistic children and kids with special needs in the same classrooms as uh other as regular kids, and i just saw this juxtaposition and the head of that. that school is uh a christian but it's a state school, so there's no prayer in the school. and then the other school is fully christian but it's not a state school, so they don't have money in the school. and i wanted to have dinner with uh. both of the principals come to find out the principal and these guys. they talk, maybe at a softball game or something. the principal house is one block walking distance. the principle of one schools houses one block walking distance from the school or the other principal that we're this close right now. we have the solutions, but we all have our backs to each other. we need to face each other and like how we're facing each other right now and have these conversations. the solutions for utopia are in front of us, but what's holding us back? fear. people are sitting on their money. really, they're sitting under their money. i know i'm gonna give you a thing, okay, that's it. next one: did you get, did you get, my perspective of the real, the way i would approach you, would bring people together to communicate and try to figure out a better strategy for health care? yeah, i mean. and and in reality, some financial realities that have to be in london when you go to the hospital. no, let me give you the american example. when i go to the hospital, i had something wrong on my foot three years ago. they asked me: you know, do you want to take something? do you want a pill? i said no. five doctors and nurses ask me if i want a pill. this is like worse than when you don't accept water on the plane and they just keep like: do you want some more water? i'll take the water, all right, because i don't want to be responsible for the water. like when the plane takes off and it goes like this and i gotta like hold it in my. i don't want no water. like i don't even know my like masseuse said i should drink more water. uh, so the so they, they, there are like people. they have christmas parties about bonuses, about giving out more medication. so we talk about they do. look at this: how much does the earth cost exactly? there's no price on it, right? we make money. money's not even backed by gold anymore, so it's engineering. it's where the budgets are going. and, like it was the best part on uh, one of the best parts on the sixth sense is when, um, when they looked at this video and it was a nanny, uh, they saw that the nanny was like putting stuff in, like the porch for the child that had passed, and he- and then they said the ladies looked at the nanny and said you were keeping her sick. you're keeping her sick. like we are sick. we are sick, uh, abortion culture, sex culture, uh, capitalism, we are sick. we as a people, as a, not just the american society of the world- we are sick and we are keeping ourselves sick. we're all responsible. like the black mirror episode. we're all responsible in some way. we all play some part. like, if i go to pornhub in the very next thing, um, and i uh and like backslide and do this because i struggle with this since i was like five years old, right, and the very next thing says something about like trafficking, then i literally would have to like put my hand over that part and like, click the thing i'm going to and thinking that, like i'm not a part of the, the bigger conglomerate that we're all, oh, i'm not really a part of the main problem because i'm- i'm not as bad as that guy and i'm not looking at this part and i'm not like we all play a part of it. then we're all sick in some way and the world has been designed to keep us sick. like spatial engineering based off faith can save a world, literally like building will save the world. spatial engineering, like engineering not going to space, engineering our spaces, the amount of space that we need, the way that we interact with each other, how close we are to our loved ones, our families, how close we are to our jobs. we got to experience a lot of this. some people it wasn't good, some people it's better. they were connected with their children and their families in a whole different way, like we're talking. this is my thing. we could talk about all of these important current issues. there's deeper reasons, based on the slave mentality, based on fear, based on protectionism- not specifically white supremacy and racism- protectionism. people just want to protect what they have and there's this like photograph where you're holding, um, the guys, the little girls, holding a teddy bear, and jesus has a giant teddy bear behind her, um, her back, i mean behind his back. she don't want to give up the small teddy bear for the bigger teddy bear that jesus has waiting for her. there is prosperity for all families here on earth right now, in service to god. there's happiness, there's joy. it's not a possibility, it's a probability. just the fact that god woke me up, got me here safely and allowed me to talk to you right now and spark the minds of the people that are anointed to change the world is already what god wanted me to do. if i didn't take a breath after this point, god had me here for this conversation right now, but i think god has more for me playing. i don't think they gonna come for me until he done, until he done with me. they ain't gonna come for me until they done with me. i want to make it so if someone wanted to sample and put in a beat, it'd be like perfect [Laughter]. they ain't gonna come. they ain't gonna come for me until they done with me. they ain't gonna come for me until he done with me. uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, help yourself. you're always creating now, yeah, but do you understand what i'm saying? okay, tell me what i'm saying. what you're saying is that it's, it's your overall philosophy, the way you're approaching life. you're approaching life that there is good for everyone. if we, if we all work together, if we all work together in the spirit of the way you think, the spirit of god, that will not not approach this like with a famine mentality, but approach this like there's enough for everybody, there's an abundance. if we, if we engineer it correctly, if we think about it correctly, if we all come together with the spirit of everybody, helping everybody. this is the spirit of christianity, this is the good spirit of christianity, not the christianity that gets despised or disparaged. or, you know, evangelists driving around in private jets the the spirit of, of goodness and treating each other like brothers and sisters. yes, but this can be done on a national scale. yes, because those evangelists, or the people who who spread the word of god, you know there's people who are praying for me. you know we're praying. like i said, i like to. okay, yes, i am a genius, but one of my most genius skill sets is recognizing other geniuses and empowering them and giving them the platform. so the people that have been praying for me this whole time, you know, for jay to work for the kingdom, look at me, look at me right here, working from the kingdom. that not leaning on my ego, not leaning on anything, but leaning on god in this situation, saying let's, you know, let's, rise up together and show people what it's like to be christ like. yeah, we fall short, you know. i mean people love to like. look at the christians that are the least christ-like to judge christianity as a whole. well, a lot of people got jordans in 23 years old and don't very few of them play like lebron. you know they want to be like like mike, but there's very few people that get that close. you know it's like, yeah, yeah, what you're saying is beautiful. yeah, that they do judge the people that fail. people always go to the furthest extent, like if you talk about, uh, abortion culture, people immediately go to rape, but don't do the math on what percentage that is. and for me as a, as a christian president, you know, as i said, i go on that. i touched on him before i realize we're in an imperfect world. you know, when i talk to, uh, my fellow christians and we talk about meat, we talk about guns, we talk about, in this imperfect world, there's a transition between where we are today and where we're going. does, yeah, does, the meat industry have a great impact on, uh, the ozone? i, from what i hear, it does, and we have to transition. one of the things i wanted- it's a thought that came in, and thank you for allowing me to give you the thoughts that are coming into my head, as opposed to trying to put me on a grid because i'm off the grid period- the way i think, clearly i paint in circles, you know, i don't, i don't paint inside of the lines, right? so i was thinking about- i forget the lady's name starts with a t, but she changed the meat industry because she was hsp, like highly sensitive person, that's uh, and put the, uh, the cows in a, in round bins and uh. that's what i'm doing when i say spatial engineering. that's what i'm doing with our spaces that i'm designing with the farms, and uh, with the school systems, the unlearned systems, the. what are the things that you're going to need, you know, in the future, because 30 years we don't, we don't even know. we think probably the things that we're learning in school right now won't even apply to people when they're 30 years old that are learning this stuff. you know age, especially with technology, especially with technology and the people who design the curriculums, way before technology. yeah, so i mean i was in computer programming when i was uh, uh, eight years old and i used to know how to program this, how i got into music. in seventh grade i had a amiga computer that had 4096 colors. that's why i got that one uh, and i would program the different sprites and uh, draw out each of the characters and animate them. and i thought that was the next frontier to like, and because i would do like animation books, i wanted to be a animator. and then i started doing the the music they had a music program on, do the music for the video games. and then i found myself running home from school all the way from 95th street to 119th street to go and just keep programming the music. so this is like third age, you know 12, 13, you know programming video games and that being the gateway into programming music. i got a longer story about that, but i know you want to ask me some more serious stuff. so, um ding, okay, this is a big one. the military. um, if you really did become president, when- excuse me, when you do become president, you're going to have to deal with hostile governments. you're going to have to deal with hostile militaries and dictators. you know people in another country that in other countries that don't have a value of human life and throughout history we've had immense problems because of that, because of military conflicts. how do you think you will approach that? i mean, you will be the commander-in-chief of the greatest army the world has ever known. if you're in that position and we have to deal with some sort of a military action with china, what if china takes over taiwan? what if they invade taiwan? what if something happens with syria? what if something happens with iran? what if something happens with russia? and you have to make decisions about military action? have you thought about this? yes, i would. i have to say again, like covet, i'm a civilian and people could have all their perspectives that they could have of what they would do in that situation. but i would have the greatest professionals on the planet, the most skilled people that have all the experience that would present the information and i would make the most sound, rational decisions and i would follow god's will in my approach to, to dealing with these other countries, to dealing with these other leaders. there's there's something about, you know, our president's personality and the the leader of north korea's personality: where there's, there's a level of common respect and- and that's the reason why they were able to talk, and we, we- the fear had been taken off of us- like people who are, uh, god-fearing, self-made, uh, servants of their people. these, these other, you know, scary dictators. they feel like they're that for their country and if they see a president that they know is just taking a check or part of a bigger conglomerate- now, i don't want it. like i said, i want to denounce any of the uh, uh candidates- then it's, it's very, it's very transactional. it's, um, and i just said a prayer in this situation. this isn't. you said a prayer because of what, what, what, what motivated you to say a prayer right there? the seriousness, the significance of this subject? yeah, absolutely, we can. we can't jump from jokes about this to, you know, joking about people's lives, right, we have to completely be still in this moment. allow god to guide our steps and ask the right questions with the highest ranking officials possible. this isn't something that you just wing or that you just come in and say: i did a bit of research, i got this like political answer right. that's gonna get a rise out of people like this is, this is people's lives. this is, you know. this is a whole different, you know, setting or or mood than what this whole, uh- interview has has been about. this is, you know, people are suffering in the throughout, all sides: in in in israel and in nigeria and haiti. we're, we're suffering the police force, in in in in chicago and the, the people, the people who have been harmed by police and the police. like this all is going to take serious time, like time is love. it's going to take that love and that time and moments of listening, moments of understanding, moments like when my wife goes and visits people in prison and she hears their stories. she says: i understand, i understand why you're into in, why you're in that situation- i would have did the same thing in this situation- and for us to go to foreign countries and really understand why that they're- you know that they're in these situations, or why the killing has gone for so long, or why the hate has gone so long and why the pain just keeps on. you know compounding and compacting. there's the empathy that i just have as an artist that it doesn't become a two plus two equals four situation. my dad was actually a a a psychology major and a christian, uh, therapist. and this therapy- we talk about therapy period. it's like we need healing internationally, not just selfishly for america. america is number one internationally. we need healing and i would lead, i would. i would lead with with love, dignity, the responsibility to our country, the coverage of our families, of our soldiers, and in full service to god and to the american people. it's the. there's a mode that i would be in in that position, like when i was a producer and i was a really young man. i was running around hopping on trains or, you know, hopping turn styles and stuff, and like stealing from cars- and i mean not stealing cars but stealing clothes from stores- and, um, then i was selling music and, uh, you know going and buying leather jackets and stuff. then you know dating a whole bunch of girls going on tour and then i had a family and i had to adjust a lot of my mentality and behavior to grow and be the man that i needed to be. then god called me and i gave my life to christ and god is helping me to be the christian that i need to be and when it's in god's will that i become the leader, i will become the leader that i need to be. so right now, as i said, i'm a civilian, but my heart, my mind and my spirit is in a place where i feel i know that i'm being, i'm being called to captain this ship. like when roosevelt went in america was in shambles, when i, when i'd say those things about those numbers, when i went to adidas, when i went to gap, like i'm the person that you actually call when things are not going so well, you know, you have that. the mob movies is the guy that goes, cleans up everything and like, puts everything. i'm. i'm like the forensic where, in the same way, how you saw my mind touch on ten things at a time and then i had to say ten sentences at a time, if i could say them, or maybe narrow them down to seven. that's the way my mind takes, you know, information in and then it synthesizes it and it comes out as a song or comes out as a product, using that mentality as a leader, fearless, god-fearing, we will heal. we will show the world what america should be the dream. you said all this [ __ ], all the things that you've said in the most non-politician way. i've ever heard anybody describe these things. i know you really mean these things. this is, this is. it's resonating with me that you're being a hundred percent honest and natural, and that's that's what we're missing in politics today. i mean, it's one of the things that made people excited about trump, as at least he was an alternative to the political talk. he was an alternative to politicians speak where you know they're being dishonest and disingenuous, but you just accept it. you know they're reading things that have been written by speech writers, but you just accept it because it says the things that you want to hear, checks the boxes that'll say, okay, you got my vote. what you're saying, though, is what you really feel and you really think, and you're not saying it like a politician, and that's what's going to resonate and people going to be mad at me. if you get pregnant, you become president. you made kanye west seem likeable. you turned him into the [ __ ] president. you made him seem like a rational choice for president, this conversation exposes a side of you that i don't think anybody's ever seen before, and a long-form conversation where you realize that you, you are a visionary. you do, you do have. these ideas are real. you're not posing, it's not [ __ ]. this is who you are and your well thought out response, particularly to the idea of military conflict. it's very impressive, man. praise god. i'm glad i did that. prayer, brother. listen, we're three hours into this. let's wrap this up on a beautiful high note. um, so people can write you in if they want to. and uh, we have uh, a, we have a video on that. brian- yeah, except brian will play this video on- on how they can write you in. and uh, we'll wrap it up here here. it is how to write in kanye west on your ballot. now, for people that are watching this: on youtube, you'll be able to watch this, and on uh, on spotify, you'll be able to watch this, but if you're just listening, you just got to go down to the part where it says: or write in: uh, it's pretty straightforward: write in candidates. um, it'll show you where you can write it in. this video will be available. this video is on youtube, right, it's on his uh twitter. it's on twitter. okay, write in kanye west on your ballot. it's gonna be very interesting to see what happens with this. [Laughter]. i'm telling you, man, that was one of the most interesting and impressive uh answers to any question, because it was so obvious that you were. you were coming from the heart, and that's that's what we all need right now. we all need no [ __ ]. absolutely well, thank you, brother. it was uh an honor really. thank you, pleasure. i'm glad we finally did it. yeah, awesome. this won't be the last time. all right, let's do it again. all right, goodbye everybody. [Music] you."
