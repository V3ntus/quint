"the jurgen experience. i mean, i grew up loving woody allen and and that's a tough as a jew from new york, that's a tough one to swallow. right there it is. now try re-watching manhattan and if you're comfortable watching it, you're probably a pedophile. you know, i don't remember manhattan. it's incredible, but it's [ __ ] weird. what year was that? it's in the 70s. it's uh, black and white it. my friend ron on hershberg has a great line about that movie where he said it's basically a romantic comedy for pedophiles, because the end of the, the end of the movie is not like i [ __ ] up by dating a high school girl. it's that he's sad that it didn't work out. really, yeah, i might not have ever mariel hemingway- oh, you know what i? i definitely didn't see it. it's uh, i mean it's so. she's in high school, she's a- you get this- she's 18- at dalton, which is where jeffrey epstein taught, and uh, this is the 70s, that's when he taught there. alan and epstein are, but this is my. i mean it's a little weird, right? yeah, i mean, here's the [ __ ] up part, though the opening is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen in a movie. it's just his like love letter to new york. it's gorgeous, and i, i grew up like worshiping woody allen. he's done some weird [ __ ]. he definitely has. yeah, i mean, there's no doubt about it. he married his stepdaughter. i mean that enough. that that alone is not good. yeah, no, i mean that's crazy. and then there's allegations from the other: uh, kids, yeah, were they coach, were they not? i don't know? the one kid, yeah, right, yeah, i don't know. but it's enough to go, it's enough to be blamed. yeah, it really bummed. yeah, yeah, you ever listened to his stand-up? his old stance, it's brilliant, it's brilliant. he was a great. that's what's where you're like: oh, you're a great short story writer, you're a great stand-up, you're a great filmmaker. and then you do some weird jazz thing on the side. that no one. yeah, i have friends who are like, do you want to watch them? like, do do i want to watch the thing he's fifth best at? no, do you want to watch me play checkers? no, [ __ ], that [ __ ]. i don't want to watch woody allen at the carlisle. i could give a [ __ ]. i guess if i was like, really a hardcore woody allen fan, i'd go watch it just to see him do something that he loves. you know, maybe the carlisle where you pay 26 dollars for a manhattan i would go see, like hunter s thompson play drums, you know, even if he sucked just because such a hunter fan. you know, i loved woody allen. like that is like he. he loved new york in a way where we felt cool as new yorkers to be like [ __ ] woody. it's woody allen. i used to see him on the street all the time and he was just anytime you'd be like woody, he'd just like run. it was amazing, he just run away from you, uh. but i knew a. i was working at a summer camp in the summer or something. i was like a counselor and i saw him and i was like woody and he just ran. we're just him run away from kids. but uh, you know, uh, woody allen. annie hall is like the. i mean as comics. that's like the. yeah, that's like the prototype right there where you're like whoa you made. it's also the perfect rom-com because they don't end up together like there's so many. it's such a run hollywood at that time, especially rom-com. yeah, and i ain't heating [ __ ] rules. yeah, diane keaton's great. what was the film that he made with? uh, who's the guy with the [ __ ] up nose? jeez, ellen wilson, owen wilson? yeah, we're here. what's it is [ __ ] up. it kind of works with him because he's so handsome. like, having that [ __ ] up nose kind of balances it out where you like him more. that's a great movie midnight in paris. it is very good, but it's him. he's playing woody allen, like everyone is john cusack on broadway. yeah, another great movie. another great movie. what do you have? are you playing woody? they all just feel real bad about working with them. now, though, it's so strange. yeah, they try to kind of defend him a little bit, and no one who's ever defended him like i get. i mean they all kind of avoid it when they can, but it's one of those things. it's like, what do you do? yeah, i mean it's tough. he's one of the greatest. i mean polanski's another one, right, you think of like the greatest. chinatown is one of the greatest movies ever. fantastic movie. it's impossible to watch that and not see. i'm not enough of a film guy to like notice. you know great cinematography. when you watch that movie you're like every frame looks beautiful. yeah, it's insane. yeah, sometimes creeps are really good at a thing, isn't it? [Laughter]? creeps are good too. that's the problem is throughout history, well, you know, when you're? we were talking about this the other day- that, like socrates and plato, a lot of these guys that we associate with some of the most brilliant things that anybody ever wrote, were pedophiles. yeah, like, there was a lot of that going on back then, and maybe that's where they got their, their powers, or something [ __ ]. kid just makes you really good at your art. i don't know, i don't think so. no, no, [Laughter]. but uh, what's his face? uh, uh, [ __ ]. baldwin. alec baldwin. yeah, he's the only guy that like defends him now. yeah, pretty openly. like i need some allies. yeah, he needs somebody on his team. did you see tim dillon did alec baldwin's podcast? i thought that was like the most on brand perfect thing. i saw that. i was like good."
