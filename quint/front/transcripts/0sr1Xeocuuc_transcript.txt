"there's a supermassive black hole, the center of every galaxy. yeah, there is also other black holes that aren't necessarily in the center of galaxies. yeah, so these little ones, a little, they a few times the mass of the Sun, and they're from collapse tiles. so they are stars at the end of their life, very bigger than the Sun, more massive than the Sun, but they run out of their fuel and they start to collapse because gravity squashes them. and if they're sufficiently massive, then there's nothing that can stop the collapse. and so they collapse, as far as we know, to a point right, essentially an infinitely dense point. we don't really know what happens at, we don't know what happens right in the middle, but they collapse to such an extent that there's a region around it where from which light can't escape, and that's a, so nothing can escape, and that that's a black hole. and what happens to them? do they travel? are they moving through space? yeah, they're still stars, right, you know. so they they're still there, they're surrounded. this region, where have you fall in? it's called the event horizon, and if you go across that horizon, then you are going to the center. there's one way of thinking about it which is quite cool, which is that the time and space sort of flip is one way to think about it. so, in the same way that we are going into the future now, so we're going to tomorrow- there's nothing we can do about it- we are going to tomorrow. in the same way, if you fall in across the event horizon of a black hole, you are going to the middle, the singularity is called. so that's, that's your future. every, every line of your future points to the center of the black hole. so it's kind of the ultimate. I've no escape for the ultimate prison. you're gonna get squashed to an infinitely dense. so point not every star becomes a black hole at the end of its life. no, because if something like the Sun and we have a small star, it's quite small, yeah, and when it collapses there's a, there's a sort of pressure, a force, if you like, which is caused by the fact that electrons don't like to be very close to each other. so it's called the Paoli exclusion principle. but essentially what happens is that so as they get squashed closer and closer together, they move faster and faster, to get out of each other's way, if you like, and that makes a force which holds them up, and so that creates what's called a white dwarf star, so you can have a blob of matte. so they're about the size of the earth, but they're about the mass of the Sun, and so that's that's for smaller stars. they end up as these white dwarf things which are very dense objects. there's another version, which is called a neutron star, which is the same thing but for neutrons, and they they move faster and faster. so if it's, if it's massive enough that it overwhelms the electron thing, and the electrons sort of fought, crush into protons and turn into neutrons and the whole thing starts again, and so a neutron star can be, you know, elite, one-and-a-half times the mass of the Sun, let's say, but it can be about what? 10 miles across. so so that's an incredibly dense ball of matter held up by this, the neutrons moving around. it's got a fancy name, it's called neutron degeneracy pressure with ice in it. but if you go even bigger, then even that can't hold it up, and as far as we know, then there's no known force that we know of that can hold hold the thing up if it's too massive, and so that's when it just almost winks out of existence, if you like. oh, it collapses and collapses and collapses, and that's when you get a black hole. we try to put that in a perspective of the earth. the Sun is a million times bigger than the earth, yeah, and this, this neutron star, is, would you say, one and a half times the mass of this, yes, miles wide. yeah, yeah, certain little loads of those around that they call pulsars. so we see those all over the place, though the first one that was discovered was called lgm1 because they spin very fast, and then it was called lgm1 because it's a very regular pulse and they thought it was little green men because it kind of jokingly a little green men one. and then so, yeah, we've seen that there's one called the crab pulsar, which is in the Crab Nebula, which we saw the supernova explosion, so that's when one of these stars explodes at the end of its life and then collapses to form a neutron star, and we saw that 1054 ad. well, it wasn't there some speculation that our gal or our solar system at one point was had was a binary star system and that one of those stars had become a dwarf? I don't know, and someone had read something about that in relationship to the dense object they believe is outside the Kuiper belt. yeah, I mean, there's some evidence, there's a bit of evidence that there's something out there. yeah, yeah, because of the periodic extinctions and things on earth, like, you get periodic bombardments from out in the Kuiper belt. so, yeah, I think one of the theories is realloc extinctions. well, yes, so for, like the, you know that they've been. there have been mass extinctions on earth when a lot of the life died and then we don't know what caused all those, but sometimes their impacts from space. that seems clear. and so, yeah, there are theories that there's something orbiting out there which can disrupt all these objects out in the Kuiper belt, that sends loads of comets and asteroids inwards to the inner solar system, I think, cause havoc, and so that there's some people look at those theories."
