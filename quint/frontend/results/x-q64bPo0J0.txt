 The biggest drama in the world of chess in 15 years and maybe ever has just gotten more interesting. Yesterday I made a video after the transpirings of prior to round <span class="BestWords">four</span> in the singfield cup, where <span class="BestWords">magnus</span> <span class="BestWords">carlson</span> withdrew and put up a tweet saying that if he speaks more, he will get in trouble. <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> <span class="BestWords">niemann,</span> the individual who defeated him in the third round of the tournament, was cheated. <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> didn't say anything until the interview today after round number <span class="BestWords">five</span>. <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> has a tight-knit loyal circle of <span class="BestWords">five</span> or six people..

 <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> cheated in random chess games when he was 12 years old and played against some of the world's best chess players at the age of 16. <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> has played chess since he was 16 years old. <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> is not going to defend the world championship because he wants to play over the board..

 <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> leeman's game will be covered by nepo nepo tomorrow. <span class="BestWords">Wesley</span> plays rook b8 and <span class="BestWords">Wesley</span> plays knight fd4. <span class="BestWords">Fabiano</span> plays a move that has never been played before..

 Shark sacked a pawn and then went to win it back with knight f1, knight takes e3. <span class="BestWords">Fabiano</span> <span class="BestWords">carawana</span> has <span class="BestWords">25,</span> <span class="BestWords">60,</span> <span class="BestWords">27,</span> <span class="BestWords">60</span> points. <span class="BestWords">Mamidyarov</span> plays queen takes f1 in <span class="BestWords">21</span> moves. <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> plays knight e7 in a tournament where magnus plays. <span class="BestWords">Lanier</span> rerouted rook f5, rook b1 and <span class="BestWords">Lanier</span> won the tournament.. 

<span class='TimeStamp'>0:19:17</span> <b>"Hans has been on the better side of advantage in four games out of the first five in the chess tournament. Lanier had one chance on move 36 but he didn't take it. Hans won the game. Hans is worried about what's going on in the world of chess."</b>

 
 
 <span class="BestWords">Hans</span> has been on the better side of advantage in <span class="BestWords">four</span> games out of the first <span class="BestWords">five</span> in the chess tournament, but this game linear, showed up with very nice preparation. <span class="BestWords">Lanier</span> had <span class="BestWords">one</span> chance on move <span class="BestWords">36,</span> but he didn't take it, so the game also ended in a draw. The recap is kind of boring, but it's hard for me to speak about it because I'm worried about what's going on in the world of chess. There's a rest day from the sing field cop tomorrow. The chess gods need to take a rest..
