"Tom Cruise. it's been a pretty busy couple of weeks for the movie star, his relationship with Katie Holmes spawning a thousand tabloid headlines. he came here to our studio on Thursday for a freewheeling discussion. in the first part of our interview, we talked about his new love and his new movie, as his fiancee looked on. anything at all interesting happening in your life these days? yeah, you know same old, same old. you know what, Sam? oh, you know what. how are you handling this? I mean every magazine, every newspaper, every entertainment show. what's it like for you to be to? let me be living through this right now. I have to tell you it's, it's just a great time in my life. I'm really happy. I'm engaged, I'm gonna be married, and I can't restrain myself. I was thinking about it. won the one hand, it's got to be a little hard to see yourself everywhere splashed across the pages. another aspect of this, though, is how many actors, 20 something years into a career, can generate this kind of interest. still, you know, I just do what I do. I love making movies, and I feel privileged to be able to do that always, and it's something that I'm just living my life. we talk about life in a second, let's talk about the movie though. okay, war the world to me. I've always been fascinated by this whole concept that we are not alone in a big way in concept. do you remember your first exposure to it, to the story? I remember I was a kid and I heard about the Orson Welles radio play was my first exposure to this story. this is not just an alien movie. this story breaks down on a lot of different levels and in one of the levels your character is a father, not the best father in the world. when we were working on on the story originally three years ago, Steve and I came up with this idea of making it about a family. okay, wanna go inside. okay, want to go inside. okay, you go ahead, I want to go by myself. and so now he is forced, in these circumstances, to rise to the occasion the fourth of July, and I just think it's a. it's very human. I think that you know your father. sure, I'm a father. you know, I always wanted to be a father. you don't remember we first held your child's like tremendous sense of responsibility, life-changing, yeah, and we talked about it. but it, you know, and I even you know, not until you experience it? can you really know it? and so that that's why I wanted i wanted to imbue this story with that journey. is this a scary movie in the traditional sense of Hollywood? scary, I think it's in de in Spielberg in. scary it's out now is: yeah, I think you know you, you Stevens movies. they're films that I tease him because I say you know I know your movies better than you. you know because I know I've studied his edits so many times. I've studied his movies for Steven it's not analytical, he's just creating and he has a tremendous power because he understands the medium and it's just that great, great, great storyteller. I think he's the greatest storyteller cinema has ever known. let's talk about selling this movie. so you've just toured basically around the world getting the story of War of the Worlds out there and at the same time you've got this great thing happening in your personal life that has become the subject of so many headlines and and stories. any fear is it really? yeah, from what I've seen, you want to count three thousand four hundred, and is there any made that up? is there any fear in your part that what happens personally overshadows the movie, not never does what's? you know, I hope the movie. I don't know. you know what it's. it's, it comes down to the movie. it always comes down to you aren't being so much more open. you've been on this show in the past at times where you were in other relationships and I kind of broached the subject of a personal life and you would very gingerly steer it away. that was how we came to know Tom Cruise. and now you're saying: you know what, I'm okay with it. so it is a. it does seem like a different guy, yeah, but it's still there, still writing it. gigant understand all that stuff. we stayed, still write it. they'd still talk about it and and the thing is is that I still feel that I always feel I will talk about what I feel, what I want to talk about, right, and I won't talk about what I don't want to talk about, and it just doesn't matter. it comes down to the movie. you know, and I also feel mad. I'm living my life and and and I feel- and I feel fortunate, you know, I feel really fortunate and I'm excited- said something that made me think about something, and if you get out there and talk about it, it kind of takes away a lot of their power to make stuff up, doesn't it? because you're telling the real story. where does it leave them to go? yeah, but here's the point it's I don't even get into that game, I'm just living my life, man, it's not, it's something that I just live in my life and and I'm doing the best that I can and doing it in a way that I feel is right. and I think that when I like hearing good news, you know I like hearing. you know, if something good happens to you, it's nice. I like sitting here talking you, I mean before- and we're you know, you're you know it's it's I like hearing good news from people and it's something that I'm happy. so if you like hearing it, you must want to share it too. yeah, and you know what, and I think it's I. so when you hear the cynics- mr Cruz- and you've heard them- who say this is publicity for a movie, this relationship, or this is Tom Cruise and is in his 40s, trying to become or stay relevant for a younger audience and that's why he's out there talking about this relationship with this lovely young lady who happens to be sitting right over there, how do you respond to that? you know what? there's always: cynics. there's, there's always, has been there, always will be. do you laugh about it? just bug. you know you gotta. just I, I have never worried, Matt, about what other people think and what other people say. Katie, close your ears for a second, okay, you, you have said that Katie is the real thing, she is sensational, she's magnificent. can you explain to me what she's brought to your life that hasn't been brought to your life in the past? I don't want to compare things, I just say, oh yeah, oh, you don't know. no, because you know it, but what it is? it's that thing where you just in life, when it just happens, right, you know, it's just you meet someone and it's I can't even describe it. Katie has mentioned that she is embracing, or at least exposing herself and opening herself up to Scientology. at this stage in your life, could you be with someone who doesn't have an interest? you know, Scientology is something that you don't understand. it's like you could be a Christian and be a Scientologist. okay, Scientology something doesn't replace religion and it is a religion because it's dealing with with, with this, the spirit. you know you as a spiritual being and it's something that there's tools that you have, that I can actually that you apply to your life. coming up, the mood changes a bit. you're gonna see a fiery Tom Cruise talk about his attack on Brooke Shields. antidepressants and Ritalin for kids- here's a sneak peak. it's very impressive to listen to you because clearly you've done the homework and and you know the subject and you should. and you should do that also because just knowing people who are on riddlin isn't enough. you should be a little bit more responsible in knowing I'm really describing Ritalin, Tom, and I'm not. it gets a little testy and you'll see that coming up in our next half hour and the tone of the discussion took a turn. I've never agreed with psychiatry. ever before I was a Scientologist, I never agreed with psychiatry and then, when I started studying the history of psychiatry, I started realizing more and more why I didn't agree with psychiatry. and as far as the Brooke Shields thing is, look, you gotta understand. I really care about Brooke Shields. I I think here's a wonderful and talented woman and I want to see her do well, and I know that psychiatry is is a pseudoscience. but, um, if she said that this particular thing helped her feel better, whether it was the antidepressant or going to a counselor or a psychiatrist. isn't that enough, Matt? you have to understand this. here we are today where I talk out against drugs and psychiatric abuses, of electric shocking people- okay, against their will- of drugging children, with them not knowing the effects of these drugs. do you know what adderall is? do you know riddlin? do you know now that ritalin is a street drug? do you understand that? the difference is, this was not a male, though, madam, this was an advancing your question, madam asking a question. I understand there's abuse of all of these. now, you see, here's the problem. you don't know the history of psychiatry. I do. aren't there examples? and might not Brooke Shields be an example of someone who benefited from one of those drugs? all it does is mask the problem, Matt, and if you understand the history of it, it masks the problem. that's what it does. that's all it does. you're not getting to the reason why there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance. so it was part of depression to you. is in that kind of a psychological Google, godly goop? no, no, I did not say. I'm just asking what you know. would you know all apps that, Matt? that is that posted now? now you're talking about two different things. that's what she went on the on a depressant for. but what happens? the antidepressant? all it does is mask the problem. there's ways of vitamins and through exercise and various things. I'm not saying that that isn't real. that's not what I'm saying. that's an alteration of what what I'm saying. I'm saying that drugs aren't the answer, that these, these drugs are very dangerous. they're mind-altering, anti-psychotic drugs and there are ways of doing it without that, so that we don't end up in a brave new world. the thing that I'm saying about Brooke is that there's misinformation- okay, and she doesn't understand the history of psychiatry. she doesn't understand in the same way that you don't understand it, man. but a little bit. what you're saying, tom, is you say you want people to do well, but you want them to do well by taking the road that you approve of, as opposed to a road that may work for them. no, I'm not. well, if anti depressants work for Brooke Shields, why isn't that okay? i I disagree with it and I think that there's a higher and better quality of life and I think that promoting for me personally. so you're saying what I can't discuss, what I wanted to show you. absolutely. I know, Ben, but Matt, you're going in and saying that that I can't discuss. I'm only asking: isn't there a possibility that do you examine the possibility that these things do work for some people, that yes, there are abuses and yes, maybe they've gone too far in certain areas, maybe there are too many kids on ritalin, maybe electric shock, your kids on ritalin? I'm just saying but but aren't there examples where it works? you don't even you're, Glenn, you don't even know what reeling is. if you start talking about chemical imbalance, you have to evaluate and read the research papers on how they came up with these theories, Matt. okay, that's what I've done. then you go and you say: where's that? where's the medical test? where's the blood test that says how much ritalin you supposed to get your? it's very impressive to listen to you because clearly you've done the homework and and you know the subject and you should, and you should do that also because just knowing people who are on riddlin isn't enough. you should be a little bit more responsible in knowing- I'm really describing Ritalin, Tom, and I'm not telling anyone else to do. are you saying nightmares, some people who seem to have been helped by it, but you're saying: but it's, this is a very important issue, Isis very well, you know it and you're, you're here on the Today Show, right and to talk about it, in a way of saying, well, isn't it okay? and being reasonable about it when you don't know- and I do. I think that you should be a little bit more responsible in knowing what it is like, because you could you communicate to people, but you're now telling me that your experiences with the people I know, which are zero, are more important than my experiences. what do you mean by that? you're telling me what's worked for people I know, or hasn't worked for people, or I know, and I'm telling you, I've lived with these people and they're better. so you're, you're advocating it. I am NOT. I'm telling you, in their case, like what's in their individual case, it worked. I am NOT gonna go out and I get your kids on ritalin. it's the cure-all man in the end I have. but here's the point. what is an ideal scene in life? okay, ideal scene is someone not having to take antipsychotic drugs. I would agree, okay. so now you look at you go okay. a departure from that ideal scene is someone taking drugs- okay, and then you go, okay. what is the theory in the science behind that that justifies that. let me take this more general, because I think you and I could go around in circles on this for a while and- and I respect your opinion on it- do you want more people to understand Scientology? is that? would that be a goal of yours? you know what I absolutely you know you go about that. you just communicate about it and the important thing is, like you and I talk about it, whether it's: look, if I want to know something, I go and find out, because I don't talk about things that I don't understand. I'll say: you know what I'm not so sure about that, I'll go find more information about it, so I can- I can- come to an opinion based on on the information that I have."
