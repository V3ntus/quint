"max verstappen is absolutely rapid. why? well, he has the best car, but so does perez, and when max started p14 at spa, perez started second and max still won by just under 20 seconds. so what makes him so outrageously fast? and are those two red bulls definitely the same? because max's car looked like an absolute rocket ship, though i'm going to use my years of racing experience and driver coaching to show you how max is finding so much time. let's get into it now. this week's race at spa is the perfect example of what makes max so good. he had everything: intelligent racecraft, great overtakes and just raw race pace. but before we get into that, we need to thank today's sponsor, established titles. here at drive 61, we have a growing team of top tier employees- editors, writers, event managers and social media executives, but in recent weeks it's got even more elite and, thanks to established titles, they have been changing their names. so now we have lord jackson, lady caitlin and lord james. so, not to be outdone, i followed suit and spoke to established titles about making me a lord. and here's how it works: established titles register you as the land owner of as little as one square foot of land and, thanks to an old scottish tradition that makes you a lord or a lady, and you even get this certificate with your own plot number and a crest of authenticity. and

so back to the video. first we need to add a bit of context. the stackman took engine penalties coming into the weekend so it was always going to start at the back. but due to other drivers also taking penalties, he would line up 14th on the grid after setting a time quicker than them in qualifying. both alpha towers conveniently started from the pit lane after making changes post-qualifying, which moved him up another two spots. from the start, max routinely and calmly carves its way through the field and passed his teammate for the on track lead on only lap 12, despite two laps behind the safety car stalling his progress as a quick aside wasn't max measured in those first few laps, it was very hamilton. in a way he was making passes whilst minimizing risks, unlike hamilton. actually, in that race he knew he had time to pass people, so he made sure to take the right opportunity each time, and that's the benefit of knowing you're the fastest on track. for example, up at likum on lap one, max was battling alban and had the inside line for the second right hander, but with stroll coming back onto the track in front, verstappen saw the ever closing gap, he backed out, conceded the place to album and lived to fight another day. in a previous year i think we would have seen max try and barge his way through with potentially disastrous consequences, but this year he was past both of them within a lap and a half of green flag racing, as the red bull started on different tyres and were battling traffic at the start of the race. the most representative stint to compare the drivers is the middle one, when both cars are on the medium tires and in clear air. max is consistently eight tenths of a second faster than perez, and that's why perez was lapping over a second faster than the next fastest car, george russell's mercedes, as carlos science struggled with the tyres falling away. so, without doubt, the red bull was the fastest car, but max was faster still, and being eight tenths of a second faster than your teammate is a lot. speaking of tyre degradation, this chart shows that max was even the best at this. his gentle curve, shown in yellow, is a stark contrast to the sharp inclined lines of science perez and russell in the first stint, despite being on a tyre a step softer than perez and russell and battling through traffic. this translates to max being able to maintain a higher pace while keeping his tyres in a better window, signs that the driver and the car are at one with each other and in that perfect setup window. this only compounded the difference between max and the rest of the field. at spa, he was able to push longer, while, in particular, the ferrari of science had to drive conservatively to make sure his tires reached the end of their stints and lost bundles of time in the process, as he was unable to maximize his strategy. this chart is courtesy of project f1 on twitter. go and give them a follow. as for leclaire, well, a rogue verstappen tear off, got caught in his breakdown and caused it to overheat, ruining his race. proof that when you're performing well like verstappen, everything goes right for you. now we also need to do a comparison between the ferrari and the red bull. it's been a theme of the 2022 season that the red bull has been faster in a straight line, while the ferrari has the advantage in the corners. but even this got thrown out of the window at spa. for this, we'll leave it to scarbs to explain. well, throughout the year, the red bull really has been the class of the field in terms of its top speed. so when we look at spa, you would have expected them to be particularly quick. but it's that middle sector, with all of the fast corners, where you need the downforce, and this is perhaps where rebel trailed ferrari in the early part of the year. but there's something about the setup of that car, how they're getting that underfloor to work. so we're not talking about the wings now, we're talking about them- ground effect tunnels that have been so important a part of these new regulations, and they've really got that working now and it's very consistent. so if we look at that middle sector at spa, you can see ripple had the downforce, yet still they had the efficiency in the car to have that top speed. so they trumped ferrari in every sector. but then, if we go a bit further. you look back at hungary high downforce circuit. again, red bull had that downforce to beat ferrari. this was seen in qualifying when the ferraris were having to tow each other down the camel straight just to keep up with the red bulls. and even then science only gained about half a tenth of a second relative to verstappen on their fastest runs. this was to be expected but, as scarbs mentioned, it's in the corners where the red ball has stepped up in spa and blown the opposition away. watching the on boards, verstappen is smooth and consistent with his steering inputs, while the ferraris are fighting at the wheel which, as we all know, isn't a fast way to drive. they're having to make corrections mid corner and on the corner exits, while verstappen makes one steering put into the corner and one on the exit. absolutely no dramas. delving deeper into the telemetry of their fastest qualifying lap, it looks like max is happy to give up the advantage on the corner entry in favor of getting a better exit, which is really important with the long straights at spa. as shown here at the source and turn 10, max clearly breaks earlier but is able to rotate the car better in the mid corner, which leads to a faster traction phase. science gains time in the first phase of the corners, but max gains more time out of them consistently. it's hard to show this in the race, as max is simply quicker everywhere, shown here by the chart of their first laps. on the mediums, max is the white line and carlos is the gold. the white line is clearly higher everywhere, highlighting max's supreme pace. now to compare max and checo. but before we get into the chorus of the car is built for max, let's throw it over to scarbs to explain in more detail about this red bull. so what is the difference between those two cars? now, i don't think fundamentally, there is one car that's max's and another one which is sergio's, in terms of setup and parts and bits and pieces. um, because that's just not how any f1 team operates. i just think that the way the red bull is operating, it just really suits max rather than it suits sergio, and this will kind of see itself in different ways. first we see that qualifying difference, but equally, in the racing you see such a large lead from so far back of a starting position for match. you think, well, what was sergio doing? the problem is when you're not getting the car working just how you like it. your tire management suffers as a result and this tends to make that gap appear wider than it actually is on pure pace, and that will affect both qualifying and the race. but if you look at the telemetry, max was faster on the straights than perez. some of this was based on a good exit, but, to be honest, not that much. now. this does make more sense when you take into account that max's engine was brand new and czechos had already completed the hungarian grand prix, at least when you actually look at the two power units between the two red bull drivers and max, obviously getting all of the updated parts for this weekend, which certainly gave them a performance advantage at this race and particularly a power hungry circuit like spa. the question is is: how much difference does it make? does max suddenly have an extra 10, 20, 50 horsepower? and the answer actually is no, he doesn't. there's no difference in the peak horsepower that these engines producing. so the difference actually just comes then, not in the amount of horsepower, but how often can the driver turn the strap mode up to get that peak horsepower? now, obviously, as an engine gets used, you use up its life and its life will be made up of a balance between kind of low power running and high power running, which they'd use in qualifying the first few laptops strategically through the race. when you have a new power unit, what you can do, particularly if you know that power units not going to have to run for as many races as as another one. for example, you can turn the strap mode up more often and it was quite clear from max's performance through the race he was running in higher modes more consistently because of this fresher engine. as scarbs points out, the new engine in max's car would have had an effect on his race pace more than his qualifying pace as he was able to be in higher engine modes for longer, especially down the straights as he carves his way through the field. that doesn't tell the whole story of why max is so much quicker than perez. so where is verstappen finding his time on perez and the rest of the field? well, firstly, he dealt with the tires much better than perez, so he was experiencing less degradation and that gave him some lap time. but the majority of the time is in the driving style max has adopted to suit this car and the quali lap is the best to show you this first through the source. the red bull was able to hug that apex much better than the other cars. but max actually took a slightly different racing line as well. he was actually braking earlier than perez, giving up some time on the way into the corner. but that allows him to rotate the car really early and then get on the throttle earlier. and because the run down the next straight is so long, the extra four kilometers an hour that max carried through the corner was worth one and a half tenths by the time they get to le. then the middle of the lap was where he was dominant over everyone. he carries more corner speed than perez in every single corner, and this is so profound that it almost looks like max is on a softer tyre than perez. it just looks like he has more grip. but just look here he's quicker through no name puwon, fanya and then both stavalo corners, and it wasn't just in the faster corners. in the slow final chicane at the bus stop, max is able to brake later and carry 10 kilometers an hour more through the middle part of the corner. this gives up a little bit on the exit of the corner to perez, but by the time they cross the start- finish line, the damage has been done, but it's only a short run to the finish line, so max doesn't lose much time on his way there and so extends his advantage by almost another two tenths of a second. i also broke down daniel ricardo's driving style and why he isn't getting the most out of his mclaren, and i explained that in this video here. thank you very much for watching. please remember to subscribe and i'll catch you in the next one."
