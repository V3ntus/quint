all right boys, massive, massive pod elon musk on the podcast. we want to let you guys know fullsendcom. 

 it now has a ton of 24, 7 items on it. we got some full sign classics. this is a shirt actually that we just dropped in honor of the episode go where no skinny can has ever gone before for the space theme for elon happy dad on the moon. so these are live on fullsendcom right now and we've been stepping up the clothing a lot big time. uh, these t-shirts are brand new. they're like super heavyweight quality. 

 so if you guys want to rep full send, go to fullsendcom right now. um, there's a ton of items, including these hats too. oh, it's not a happy dada, but happy dad. hats were there too. 

 yeah, they're there. the happy dad has you guys want them. so i don't know it. go, let's get into the fight. i don't know how we actually. i do know how we landed this, but we're headed, hopefully, to go get a podcast with elon musk. 

 pretty crazy. but john. our president has been emailing elon back and forth because they've known each other from when john used to work with bieber and then elon- uh, he said 8pm in austin, texas. so we're about to hopefully go get elon musk on the podcast. is he going to flop. 

 you guys probably already know, but we don't know right now. ready to rock fellas. new flavor of happy dad the board ape banana flavor limited edition dropping in stores one week from today. 

 the funny thing too is like you'd think banana would taste like, but it's actually fire. all right, can't believe this is happening, but it's going down, going down in, i guess, 16 minutes. elon musk is pulling up to the full. send podcast crazy. yeah, round of applause. 

 this is a huge podcast. you guys are fired up, we're fired up. elon musk. john shahidi shout out to john: yeah, thank you, but like, like, what a. 

 we're gonna tell the story too. so we got saleem here, we got steiny here and we got president fulson john sitting in on this episode. um, steve could not be here and this episode is pretty much dedicated to him too, because he's a huge elon fan. 

 um, his channel was- he was too permanently deleted by youtube. but it was the ultimate mind because we landed, we had two texts, one from youtube that the channel is being permanently deleted and one from elon confirming the podcast. so we're like: wait a minute. yeah, i know freaking out here are we devastated. we, it was a mind shout out steve. 

 though. how long did this channel run. for two years, three years. he's been going since 20 posted. it got me emotional. 

 yeah, 2018, 2018, three years. i think he was at 4.7 something million people. i'll take 5 million subs too, which is crazy. well, i got some stats crushing the game for that long grinding. steve worked hard. you know that too. on his videos. 

 yeah, do whatever it takes. so one thing about steve, too, is people just think he's all an entertainer, but that guy gets done. he doesn't make excuses. no, he works hard, he doesn't quit, he doesn't sleep, he gets to the finish line right, and that's why i think his channel got to where it got. check out these stats i got today- steve will do it- and how many years. 

 two years of the channel. two, three years, all right, gave away 32 cars, 52 watches, three houses, over one million dollars in us cash, over three million dollars in pesos. many cars- 32, you said one of them is mine, one of them's saleems. yes, i have one one, but it got taken back. 

 no, i gave that one, we gave that one away, but i have one, one of those watches. take them back too. yeah, i didn't do the net amount okay, yeah, you know, but um, but yeah, it's just crazy. i mean, that was very shocking to us and we're just i just can't believe it, bro, like i just it's definitely pretty wild. no, that'd make me cry. 

 i'd be crying. so we gotta crush this episode for steve, yeah, big elon fan, yeah, and honestly shout out to him for continuing to be edgy and not giving a like it takes balls to do that. yeah, it's like a trump episode, right. yeah, it's the same. 

 i mean, i think it's just the reality of the world. now. is that what's the solution, kyle. we got to build our own. we're working on it. pretty crazy, though, if you think about it: man getting donald trump, elon musk. 

 now i mean like if possibilities are endless, like we're only at a million subs on false twice. dana white twice. do we know what episode number this is like ricky fowler. ricky fowler was huge. where he follows you, ricky fowler was a huge one. good land, good line, good land, ricky's associated. 

 shout out to before we get into elon musk. shout out to steini for landing ricky fowler. and for the record, i've had a few others that are big names that we've canceled. on fair, the same stanis almost made us do yk osiris. oh, dude, why, why. 

 k is funny, why can't he. like we cancelled on wiz khalifa, cancelled on reschedule would have been good, and we rescheduled wiz for this, by the way. yeah, just for that we can't tell them a couple times. but uh, also, uh, lana rhodes, which would have been good. that's more youtubey. 

 yeah, but still it's a full-sim pocket and i mean the list goes on. i don't want to waste much time with that, but those are a couple of them. yes, crazy john, how did, how did this initially go down. um, how'd you get his email. well, john, john, we'll tell the story, we'll. we'll tell it when elon gets here, but i've been on elon for uh, nine years. 

 now it's 2013.. are you guys, boys, we're cool. i mean, he, she always takes care of me. we run into to each other sometimes here and there. 

 and first name basis: yeah, it's lit. um. no, what do you mean first. 

 what else. like he. like, does it up bro. no, but it does adapt you up her handshake. i've seen that. or is it just like a quick props and keep it moving. 

 no, it's just a headache. it was one time i saw him at uh delilah of all places. he was at delilah in west hollywood and he saw me. he jumped, he came out. what came out of his table. i didn't want to go because i don't want to bother him. he was with his family and he's like: what are you doing here. i was like i was there with a friend, so you guys should come sit over here. and we hung out and we were out to like 2 am. 

 you see one of his baby mamas. i don't remember how long ago was this. this was like, maybe like 2018, 2018.. so how long ago. you've. you've had his email since. you've always had him on what's that. and his phone number too, but you hit him over email. 

 yeah, yeah. so how did what. when did you first hit him on email. 

 how long ago. i hit him for the pod. for the pod, i want to say i hit him. um, i hit him like i think like shortly after the trump episode. 

 i sent him the trump episode, that's persistent. did he respond. he did, what'd he say. he said: not yet, but let's, he's like, but let's, you know some, maybe. 

 i think he said like something maybe sometime in the future, but i wasn't like no, it was like not yet. like first time you reached out to him, he literally was like i'm down, but not now, mm-hmm. and then how many times till now did you like message him in between, like tell the story like five times, what, what, what's up. 

 so i sent that one. i sent him some of the press about us- and you know the episode being taken down by youtube, because i know he's all about censorship as well- um the. so you're just constantly updating him on what we're doing. yeah, but i think the big one actually that i sent him recently was i did the money buys happiness. 

 um, podcast, the new, the new full send podcast. and that's when he wrote back. i forgot the wording but he wrote like: we, we could get that done soon. 

 and that's when i was with you. i was like, and you're like, well, tell them this weekend. and i was like this weekend he's like, well, i don't know if i'm gonna be in texas or in florida. and i said, well, how's monday. where will he be on monday. 

 he says most likely texas. so we'll be there. i dropped a little sammy's birthday. i was like, don't, no, no, no, if you remember my brother sammy, but it's his birthday that day too. 

 this would be really good. i dropped a little bit of that too, and he wrote back very cool text me the day of: i'll give you an address. you're intimidated by this guy though, elon musk, just because it's like low-key with someone who's so much smarter than all of us. it's just intimidating. you heard what joe rogan said. no, he said. joe rogan said you feel like a stupid person talking to him, like you feel like you're not just like on his level of smart. well, nobody is, bro. 

 i don't know. you feel stupid talking to like elon because of how intelligent he is. you know who's more impressive than this guy in the world. 

 i don't think there is not many people, not many. he's impressive because he's all. he's smart. he's also funny as man like his twitter is so funny. but one thing i didn't know about him is like he likes the party in wheels. 

 i did not know too. i didn't know he had nine, nine, baby. i feel like that's kind of common, is that. 

 true. i thought he was just like a pure nerd, but he's like: no, no, no, no, he's cool, he's a beauty. yeah, i think the thing is, when you're that successful and you're that stressed out, that's kind of your getaways partying, right, yeah, talk about trump. yeah, how was senior boy trump. yeah, it was dope. we saw trump at live. um, yeah, he came up to us. 

 or he's like: where's the knock boys. yeah, live golf, not live miami. oh, not live miami. 

 oh, no, live golf. we saw him at live golf. he's funny to see him there, yeah, and he's like: where's the. he's like: where's the nilk boys. 

 come here like i want to get some fame and really so funny. the best thing he's ever said is: you didn't fold, bro. i didn't know like politicians said that. 

 i thought that was more of like a rapper thing. it is pretty still. it's still nerve-wracking. talking to trump, though. it is like seeing him again. 

 he said the same thing, though, about not folding when we golfed with them in la a couple months ago. i think we got to get. we got to start being the connectors with these pod too. with this pod, like we could start connecting people. like i feel like one day we got to get trump and elon on at the same time. that'll be insane. 

 we can start lighter kodak and trump, kodak and trump. we need to do like a aoc and desantis. no, no, we're good with her. 

 what happened. come on, bro. that would that not be entertaining, are you not entertaining. i think we should get someone left wing on. but everyone says that like, why don't you get someone left-wing on. 

 we're down, they won't do it. but also, if i'm a politician, i'm left-wing. my attitude is: i'll come on there and destroy all three of these young kids. you're pretty off-wing, though. 

 right left-wing people don't roll like that, though. i think the only one that would go. i think the only one that would have the balls to come on would be bernie sanders. bernie sanders, i think, would do it because he's a really good debater. yeah, i'd love to go out with this with that guy. like i don't agree with everything he says, but you can't deny bernie sanders as a good debater. yeah, he's a good speaker. 

 i don't know. i mean, bernie sanders would be fire, why not. yeah, it's not like we do everybody that we like. yeah, we have for the most pelosi. that'd be huge. 

 she's attracted. we should kind of have somebody on. i think that we don't get along with and like, get, like, get the fireworks a little bit aoc would be viral. i just don't think she would ever do it. she would never do it. 

 yeah, i don't know, let's try. why wouldn't she. i'll dm her right now. 

 you're right, you aoc. oh, yeah, you'd like her. she's like she's. 

 she's like the leader of, like wing, like feminist girl. we should have heard on at the same time. oh my god, if her and andrew tate came on, it would be the craziest thing. we wouldn't have to speak. no, it'd be insane. you guys saw the milk video too. 

 check the milk video. we did it. so we're going back, we're going from andrew tate on the pod, which right now is at 5.5 million views in four days. seven, what, five point seven, five point seven million in four days as members, and now we're going straight to elon, which this one's obviously going to blow up. 

 um, but yeah, it's crazy, man, there's tons of people left what guess. two, we got bieber, we gotta get. we got drake. kim jong-un, kim jong-un, tom brady, tom brady. steph curry would be doing steph curry curry. 

 wayne gretzky, kanye west, kanye west and bob used to say it too. but kim jong-un is possible. yeah, i think it's possible too. 

 he might be the most possible. on who you just listed, yeah, probably because outside of bieber, he's like, i think north korea would want to, like, show off what a great country it is. i don't know if i would go there, i'd go, north korea, i don't know. man, no, like you, don't just fly in. 

 yeah, if they come in there, no, we'd go, i'd go, i'd go, i would go. how did rodman go. he reached, okay. so i know the story. kim jong-un reached out to jordan and said: hey, i would love to meet with you. 

 jordan denied. so we reached out to pippin. pippin denied, and then he reached out to robin and robin said it: i'm coming. like he has his own ski resort, he has his own like island, like they're literally just going there and they're just. if he's calling north korean chicks, yeah, yeah, well, that's dope. but if he's not going to around, then i'm down to go. they wouldn't, they wouldn't invite us to like keep us there and there is no way that he would let us. he might come with us, he would right. yeah, we're gonna go to north korea with trump. yeah, we gotta overlap. we're going to north korea with trump. vote trump 2024, get him in office so he could take us to north korea. i, i think it's. 

 it might not be available that week, but the boys will go. i think we got to sit back to bradley martin reflect. like we've been thinking like a lot lately: like shit's crazy, bro, really crazy. like don't think that. we don't think this is crazy, guys. 

 like i'm nervous. like every time it's like we think this shit's crazy and then it's like we just keep outdoing ourselves, yeah, and it's like we got such a great group of people, like everyone here. that's just like we're all pushing each other and like we're just. 

 we're just all kind of competitive and we just want to win and we just want to kill it and, like you said, competition, it's healthy competition. but we also want to make one another proud, all right. like i'm always thinking like, how do i make you guys proud. 

 like what do i have to do. how do i make steve proud. you know, once again, shout out to steve, i miss you, bro. crazy. 

 let's just like could have been here saying that. like it's kind of it is crazy because i have elon's car. the past six months have been the craziest months of all time, bro. oh, i didn't say that and i am grateful to be on this spot. so i appreciate you guys and the fans. he's just doing it because he gets started. i think it's been crazy. 

 yeah, i didn't know. you went over questions and stuff. yeah, it was interesting. 

 study hard, i love this man. so you, dude, for me it's like how many people in the world get an opportunity to sit down with these people. and if you have that opportunity, like you gotta show up. you know, if you don't show up and you get to sit down at the elon musk, you're not prepared. it's like that's such a waste and it's unfair to people who are like trying to get that whole life. no, no, please just say that this is gonna help you with a large graphic of women after elon musk. 

 yeah, that's like some side, like, i'm stoked for that, like, but that's not the main reason. yo, he told me i. i told him i was like yo, elon and security asked to make sure hotel staff- no one in the hotel knows elon's coming because that's usually who leaks, he goes. nah, i told a couple. he told me. 

 he told a couple girls about the pool. already, are you serious. i had to drop one of them. what are the odds elon comes and fires with us tonight. that's realistically. 

 i mean, dude, it's you're with him at delilah until 2 am. percentage-wise, 50-50.. no, i'd. 

 i'd say it's like a good 10.. do that, i think. after this we we're gonna get hammered on the pod, we're gonna hop on a jet and we're gonna go to like mexico with elon or something. i'll have fruit party with you on somebody- that'd be funny- going on stream. oh, you know what he might like. jack hand with him. he might play crash. 

 he might be a crash genius, happy genius. all right, not bad boys. i'm sure you have enough cameras. i really appreciate you coming here. we got the mic right here. that's where we need gabe. oh, you're right in there. 

 this is our shelter. it's called happy dad, all right, you a drinker or no, i don't drink alcohol. you try to give. of course i drink alcohol. 

 you gotta try one, sure. yeah, we usually do the cups if someone's drinking water elon in the house, pouring a happy dad right out of the gate, should we cheers to that, cheers, cheers. thanks for coming, elon. we really appreciate it. 

 cheers. how was your day. what'd you get up to today. so bad, just work, or like working, or how was your day. 

 should i get closer to the mic. yeah, probably, let's fix it. we're just rolling too. we just always just go straight for it. so how did how did this all come about. you guys have met what, like john said like 10 years ago. you've known each other for like 10 years at the super bowl thing. yeah, uh, mayweather fight. 

 we went to a mayweather fight together. yeah, yeah, what. what was that story. was it 10 years ago. it was 2013.. yeah, oh, that's crazy. 

 that was great. it was the canelo mayweather fight. do you remember the story about when bieber came on the plane and he brought too many people. yeah, and then, um, i forgot how many people he bought. he bought like 10, 12.. 

 it was like a bus that showed up, yeah, yeah, or many banners. there's like a lot of people, yeah, and i'm i'm freaking out and i, i and i go, i go to, uh, our boy shervin. i'm like i don't know what to do. bieber just rolled up way too many people and he's like: just go, be honest with elon. so i went and let elon know. 

 i like y'all, bro, sorry- like bieber about like a lot of people there's already. your family was on the plane too. yeah, and elon goes, don't worry, i got this handled- and him and his brother kimball. they made like one quick phone call and like 20 minutes later, another jet just rolled in. right, yeah, we got a second plane here and then we flew to vegas. 

 how does that work, elon. do you just have like jets like on demand, like that. no, that was my brother's plane, your brother's plane. yeah, that's dope. 

 what was the link with bieber. no, our buddy shervin, you wanted a terminator. sure, you know, sheriff. and, of course, you know, yeah, i know sheriff. and well, yeah, actually, you know, sheriff is a daughter. there you go. 

 yeah, she's very beautiful. yeah, this is crazy to have you here, though. i mean, we have our, we have like one of our metacard, our nfts, and in the discord, all they're saying all the time is just: please, get elon on, please, get you, okay, please. what do they want me to say. what's that. what are they curious about. a lot of everything. 

 lots, space, cars, crypto, really scarce encrypt. yeah, i think those are. link neurolink- yeah, are you. are you in texas like full time now, because you used to be in cali, right, yeah, i was. 

 i used to live in california, but i mostly live in texas these days. um, tesla, we built this giant factory called the texas giga texas, which is the biggest factory in north america, uh, just outside austin. so, um, i'm working on just bringing up that factory, uh, which is, uh, just increasing the production. it's it's like a factory's giant cybernetic collective. so you're gonna make the cybernet cybernetic collective work with thousands of people and machines, um, just a lot of- like ten thousand little things to fix. 

 basically, the team's doing great, though, so we're splitting up. they're splitting up the gigatexas factory, uh, here in austin and um, and they're building a giant rocket in south texas near brownsville. so it's a starlink rocket. it's called starship, yeah, but it will launch the starling two satellites. 

 nice, yeah, when i turn my head, can you still. what's that. what's that movement like from cali to texas. 

 like which one. do you ever miss cali. i was still in california, you know, a couple days, uh, like two or three days every couple weeks, okay, so, um, yeah, so i'm in every couple weeks. i'm in um la for a few days. barrier for a few days, basically something like that. 

 what made you move out here to texas. when you're talking about bay area, you're talking about the fremont factory. that's still there, right, yeah, so, yeah, that's the original one, right. uh, sort of our original big factory. yeah, uh, we had a tiny factory in menlo park at one point, okay, where we made the tesla roadster, the. the tesla fremont factory in the san francisco bay area is is the highest output car factory in north america. 

 it makes more cars than any other any other factory. so, and, uh, we're trying to ramp it up. so it's not like tesla's leaving california, it's just, uh, we kind of got too big for to fit in the bay area. 

 houses are crazy money. yeah, yeah, where was our flag at when. we- i don't know if you know our, our brand's called full send. so that's like our, that's like the term that we coined. yeah, i think that one of your guys that was a sponsorship. i believe that's right. 

 yeah, for some reason it's basically say that a lot too. yeah, so that's our beautiful. you see the full send. people say full standard, spacex, a lot, really, really. that's our, that's our merch. 

 okay, what context does he say full send. it's kind of like, uh, when you're going hardcore, yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, full sound, yeah, yeah, yeah, we came up with that and that's our brand and all right. so that was like when we saw that, i think that's spacex hawthorne, i think that was, uh, that was star base. 

 uh, south texas, oh, that was south texas. okay, okay, i thought it was author, we got a trademark too and like: okay, even the rocket category too. okay, i'll have to give you a sense. 

 they'll give us a free podcast appearance. so are the the starship launches. those are directly with the starlink or no. yeah, those are sending the satellites up into orbit. so the falcon 9 rocket that we launch right now is is what is able to launch the starlink version one satellites, or technically, around version 1.5 going to version 1.6 um. 

 they're like sort of seven meters long, um. so the strong two satellites are too big to be launched by falcon. they have to be launched by starship. how often are the starship launches. we've not done any orbital starship launches, but we we hope to start to, we hope to to attempt. 

 it's an orbital launch, uh, in a month or two, nice, so it depends on how the testing goes, got it. you guys know what the start link is from that. yeah, i feel like it's not talked about enough. i agree, starling should be taught. so starlink is a space-based internet. so we've got a constellation of satellites. uh, we've got now well over two thousand satellites. um, we'll soon have about four thousand satellites. 

 so we have more satellites in operation than than the rest of earth combined, really, yeah, than any other single company then. and then the rest of earth, oh my god, yeah, and this download speed is crazy on it. it's not like: is it available like now, or there's a long wait list, right. 

 yeah, starlink is available now at starlinkcom, but i thought it was a long wait list. it's like you could be perfect, though, yeah, for places that don't have internet. so, um, in order to be able to service more people in that area, we need to launch more satellites. 

 so we launched more satellites almost every week, so we're aiming the next 12 months probably do 60, 70 launches, maybe more. wow, you've been supplying uh for ukraine. you've been helping the internet there, right. 

 um, yes, it's been successful. yes, were you hesitant at all from any negative backlash from russia. well, i should probably not visit russia. 

 you tweeted something about that. why not. you know what i mean. it's probably unwise, you know. 

 i mean i mean, look what they did with the basketball player. yeah, i know, just for a vape. yeah, um, did you see what trump said recently about her. 

 uh, no, but i was like man. if, um, you know, if, if the president's working so hard to to sort of free someone who's in jail in russia for some some weed, then should we free people in america. yeah, yeah, absolutely. there are people in jail in in america for the same, for the same stuff. 

 shouldn't we free them too. uh, it's something that's legal in so many states right now as well. it's not, i mean, i, i think it's like, for it's not. 

 i mean, my opinion is that people should not be in jail for non-violent, uh, drug crimes. i agree with that. yeah, we were just talking about that too. remember when you smoked weed on joe rogan, did you get like a lot of backlash for that. i did get a lot of backlash because it's like still federally illegal. yeah, so, um, no, it was pretty nutty actually. i had to. well, because, you know, uh, so i had i had to have like random drug tests and stuff after that to prove that i'm not like a drug addict. really, yeah, by who, though. 

 who gives you the rent. even the federal government, like, like, because spacex has, uh, federal government contracts, so okay, um, and it's still illegal federally. so, like like the spacex, you know, competitors were like, hey, look at you, why are you doing anything. you know, look at him smoking, just like brazenly smoking weed on. yeah, even for weed. yeah, the drug checks me for everything randomly. i'm happy that it is. 

 i couldn't, like you, it wasn't, like, you know, pick a day, because you know, so there was like like a whole year of random drug tests. oh my god, bro, it's hilarious. so i'm like i'm sorry guys, sorry, i didn't realize it would be this big of a deal. some people must been sweating. 

 that's so funny. i know, um, like just older people, right, yeah, pretty much, i didn't even look like you puffed on it. sorry, it didn't even look like you were. not even i'm like, not even i don't even know how to smoke a joint. obviously, just look at me. i'm like have no joint smoking skills. yeah, yeah, um, well, that's what you acted like on camera. 

 no, i mean seriously i, i mean i just, you know, um, you know, i, i find we is like not that good for productivity. you know um and um. they're decriminalizing, starting in there same processes: marijuana, cali did recently, i think. colorado, washington, yeah, washington. 

 i think, yeah, it's like nobody's committing crimes on russia. no, yeah, yeah. are you in support of psychedelics. yeah, you are. 

 absolutely, yeah, i mean like a lot of those sort of anti-depression drugs just turn you to a zombie. they come from the ground too. right, which mushrooms. yeah, yeah, well, i'm saying like, i'm saying like what well, they're not, they're not in orbit, you know no. but i'm saying pills are pills are coming from a lab. so it's like yeah, yeah, no, i mean. 

 either of those two things right. um so, but they're totally natural, um, and in fact, there are mushrooms that will, that are poisonous, and achilles, yeah, so it's not like all mushrooms are good. um, i always thought, like back in the old days, you know, when they're trying to figure out which is the good mushroom. yeah, they're like, yeah, what summer poison. why don't you try that mushrooms. 

 everybody, like stands back, see what happens. okay, that one's tasty, that one, like makes you see visions and this one kills you. okay, but just make sure which is which. you know she's gonna have a guy designated tester. 

 yeah, just one of your boys like yo, dude, you go first. yeah, totally so it like there's so many different types of mushrooms, you know, and so, um, and most russians are just you can just eat them and they're fine. and then some mushrooms are, you know, psychedelic and some kill you. 

 yeah, with that joint. you know, yeah, and you're like what'd you say. mpc, like an npc, you know, and like a video game where where, like it was with a dialogue tree that's like really only has like six options or something. 

 um, that seems like most corporate ceos behave like that. i'm like, are you even real. like how do we know you're not an npc. you know, um, so i don't know, i mean it's cool, i didn't expect. i mean i feel like ceo of like all like these big companies and stuff. 

 so just sort of happened that way. i think, compared to all the other ceos, you're the most down-to-earth guy. yeah, that's what i was trying to say. like, yeah, it's cool, like ironically for space, and you're a funny ass dude, right. yeah, yeah, how come. 

 oh yeah, this is a spy chip. your twitter, your twitter feed, is on a different level. funny, like it seems as if. 

 it seems as if you don't really. i mean, i, i i strive to keep the people entertained, bro, do people give you a hard time or am i keeping with the people. you know you're crushing, like going back and forth with like people on twitter without like no lawyers or anything like that. like a man, i have to say i've gotten into trouble so many times on twitter. it's insane how often. 

 wait, wait. i want to know how you're getting away with everything. do you have some go-to people that you like run by, though, like yo, should i like. do you think everyone else is like okay, also, like show this to a friend, like is this too crazy to tweet, or what have you done. like yes and i don't know. i'll save it and think about it maybe, but i don't know um, you know, uh, but i've gotten like into legal trouble, legal trouble with tweets. you know really anything you could say, or no, well, no, i mean, some of it's like most of us like public. you know um, so, um, you've gotten into some battles though. 

 um, yeah, yeah, i know, but like, like, when i said i was like taking tales of private, i was at 4: 20.. that's hilarious. don't have a sense of humor. it turns out um, anyway, i wonder, like, with all this, elon's birthday is 69 days after 4: 20.. yeah, can you even believe that. yeah, bro, that's the funniest thing to me. how is my birthday for 69 days at 4: 20.. that's insane. that's why, like, we must be living in a simulation or something. this is too crazy. 

 yeah, that's the funniest thing to me. easy to remember, we to get through something. yeah, june 28th, nice. yeah, 6, 6,, 28,, which is also a tower day, which is two pi. what did you do on your birthday. i think just had dinner with friends. nothing special, there's nothing special this year. and like, um, actually, i'm really had a like a real party for a few years, so i used to have like really big birthday parties. 

 that's what i'm saying you could be like gatsby bro. i actually literally had a gas feed party at one point. where is that. 

 where, at my house in the bay area, which i know i'll go on. can you tell us about. um, because we weren't invited. i don't know if you were you invited, you weren't i. 

 no, i wasn't. i think post malone was post- told me once you went to like one of your parties- uh, i don't know what was that. he changed my, the house, oh, my old house in la, yeah, but he said it was a theme party too. 

 i think right, or it was a medieval theme. it was something. he was telling me something: come to a party. we had him on here like three weeks ago. 

 okay, yeah, he's cool, um, he's fine. what's the elon musk house party. look like. well, the, uh, the, my parties generally are very high production value. so, um, like i said, i haven't held a party in several years. so it's, you know, um, with cobinhole. it's like a bunch of my friends, you know, couldn't, whatever, like a lot of my friends live in other countries and they couldn't come to the us. people like you know, uh, they docked the house and whatever they, so you can see pictures of it. um, but it's like it really is like very much like a haunted mansion situation. yeah, um, it's like it's possibly the creepiest. 

 in fact, it is the creepiest house i've ever lived in. really, yeah, why not, though. why. 

 um. i and i had two parties. i won gatsby party and one sort of castle castlevania party. you got to tell us like performers anybody, yeah, yeah, performers and stuff like um stones, uh, no, no, it's like i don't have like a like a famous band or anything. it's just high production value sort of set set design. oh, it's nice, um, that's important theme parties, bro. yeah, just for in terms of the, the sort of um the set, the production value, set design of the party. um, and the uh, there are performers. they're just not like, uh, celebrity performers, you know, singers and dancers- how many people do you think go. i mean they have like, uh, not super big, like 100 or so people, cops- called her. 

 no, yeah, actually, what about the ratio with, like, women and guys. so so this that party was in in hillsborough, oh yeah, in the bay area, yeah, where like everyone goes to bed at 10 pm, um, and so like the cost got called like four times. you greet him or somebody talks to him. so it took, took a while for the police to actually even find the house, but then, like the whole neighborhood was calling the cops. 

 basically that's insane. that literally came four times and then finally we had to like to turn the music off. you know what was so creepy about the house. like it was like haunted or something fell horned. do you believe in ghosts. i mean, i, i i don't believe in ghosts, but sometimes it feels like they're a ghost or something. 

 you know how. so, uh, look in the house. so you're in your opinion, like, scientifically, ghosts, like doesn't make sense for them to exist. i've seen no actual evidence for ghosts, uh, but that doesn't mean you can't get creeped out late at night, yeah, so, uh, but, but this house was, uh, this is it. like i said this and i i had that house for many years, uh, and i tried to de-creep it as much as possible. but even after a lot of de-creeping- just like how do you decree sage you're like creepy stuff. i guess like what paintings. 

 well, furniture, yeah, yeah, for like weird pants, furniture and and like there were these, um, these animal figurines like, yeah, get those out of there. yeah, that's creepy as hell. just feel like they didn't come alive at night. yeah, you know you sleep with the light on. no, i do. no, i used to. 

 when i was a kid, i used to be like, uh, scared of the dogs. bathroom, like those lights, yeah, bathroom lights, yeah, somewhere you could see, like if someone's coming in or anything like that. yeah, yeah, um, i mean, it had this like like this, like narrow stairway down into the basement that was painted red. i just felt like it, like the place was a bit like the shining- yeah, it's a shining vibe. 

 yeah, sounds like a total shiny. sounds like i'm not staying there, but anyway, grateful parties, like if you have 100 people there. yeah, it's just creepy if you're there by yourself. yeah, so main home now is austin or texas, state of texas, main residence. i actually don't really have a main residence. um, same as us. 

 it's kind of like us just always moving around. but what's that with a boxable rumor that you actually have a box bowl. yeah, you do some prototype box bowl that's down in south texas. yeah, well, that's pretty cool. they reached out to us. 

 no, wait, what's up. no, i mean, if you get enough people on the street to say yes, you can change the street. well, if they know you're doing that. 

 or elon musk makes a call: yeah. so what do you think of the boxable. yeah, it seems, seems good. um, aren't they like. 

 what. are they like. 50 grand. 

 i think so. um, i don't actually stay in the box full, it's like. so i have, like, the house that i bought actually cost less than it's inboxable, because like 45k or something. but i've done a lot with the place, you know. so you bought a house for 45k, yeah, what is it like big or is it. no, it's small. is it very small. it's a tiny house. 

 it's a great value 45k. yeah, no, it's a tiny. it's a small, small house. 

 um, why do you do that. people have pictures of it and stuff. it's like, um, because it was right next to the rocket factory. oh, got it, so i can just literally walk to rocket factory. it's like half a mile away. you got a kitchen, living room, bedroom. it's a one bedroom, right. uh, technically it's technically a three bedroom, but it used to be a two bedroom, but the i converted the garage into a third bedroom, so crazy, yeah, it's like. 

 it's like a. a friends might come and stay in there, like i can't believe i'm staying in this house. yeah, do you like living like that if i'm there by myself. but, yeah, it's fine, you know, or just with a little axe or something, you know. yeah, so, um, the family and i- i- actually i used to- i use the box bowl as my guest house. 

 oh, nice, that's what i'm using for. is if a friend comes to stays or something, and um, then they can stay in the box pool if they want. nice, um, that should be like the full send, hotboxing for all the employees. the box, they're boxable. 

 we should do it though. they're cool, they're all the employees that safe will send. just, i think they're around like 50 grand, so, yeah, they're 15.. well, they offered they want to partner with us. they said when we come to vegas, they want us give us a tour of the factory and everything. i think it's cool. is there enough room to like party in there. 

 no, i think it would be. we could just have one for that anyways. but i have like an outdoor area by that, by back of the house, where you can party, uh, more or less like, there's like a little barbecue pit and stuff, nice. 

 so if i- i actually did- did have my. i had a small birthday party there last year, which is was just some friends invited down to starbase to hang out, um and um, yeah, that was fun, yeah, so, yeah, um. but, uh, yeah, these days i'm basically just trying to get uh starship to orbit, which is pretty tough. it's a very complicated rocket, uh, it's uh, it's one double the thrust of for saturn v, about twice the weight. so, um, saturn 5's biggest rocket ever to get to orbits. it's what sent people to the moon, um, back in the day. so making a rocket that's twice as big as the next biggest rocket that's ever reached orbit is is challenging. 

 uh, so we don't wanna end up in that boat. yeah, is that like a lot of pressure, like there's so much pressure on you, like, are you like, if this like blows up, like i look bad under pressure. is that all you think about like on a day-to-day basis. can you perform under pressure. i'm living pressure. that's rookie for you. yeah, expectations are so high. 

 no, but i can try. bohemian rhapsody: love queen, oh yeah, oh, i said yes. freddie mercury, how long is the production on the rocket from start to end. uh, well, right now it takes a long time. 

 um, this is a very big, this is the largest flying object ever made. so you know, um, we're aiming for a production rate of one a month, but right now we're at a production rate probably one every four or five months. and how expensive is it. just for one rocket, one launch, all that. 

 i don't know. it's at least 50 million dollars. marginal cost of launch: maybe 100 million. um, so every explosion it's like how pissed are you: boom, that was 100 million dollars. that's gambling. 

 yeah, put the chips on, um. why do you think we haven't been back to the moon. well, i think another way of thinking about it is that the the fact that we were able to go to the moon in 69 was such an anomalous situation. it was like reaching into the future and bringing the technology forward that normally wouldn't be there. 

 like that was not the natural pace of technology development. it's just that the united states just collectively decided that this has got to be done. you know, we kind of got it, got to beat the soviets, you know. so i don't want to sound like: have we not been back since then, or have we. there were a few trips to the moon. 

 there wasn't just one, okay. um, landings, like actually landed on the moon, okay, i think the last lightning was maybe 72.. wow, that sounds weird that we'd be so much more advanced now and we haven't gone back. 

 i agree it's totally weird. well, do you have just no interest in the moon at all. like, no, we'll go to the moon. 

 we are. we have spacex has an asset contract to take astronauts to the moon. so nasa did choose spacex to return astronauts to the moon and we intend to do that would be like the mission. well, i mean, starship is the objective. 

 it's gigantic compared to anything that's like ever been done before. so this is not like a tiny little thing lands on the moon, this is like giant-ass spaceship lands on the moon. um, you know, it's capable of putting 100 tons of failure on the moon, so a lot. you could build a moon base for starship. i mean it's, it's an, it's designed to be capable of building a city on the moon or mars. that's also that's what the system is designed to be able to do. 

 so that's insane. why is the goal right now to get to mars before the moon. no, we'll, we'll probably get to the moon first. okay, oh, really, yeah, but not built. would we build a city on it, or or not. 

 on the moon. i mean, i think we should build a city on the moon and and on mars. yeah, it's weird. 

 it's way closer than than what martial is, like nutty farts. it's more convenient. why do you want to colonize mars. i think, uh, i think it's important, for, uh, i think there's two reasons. um, that might be the leading factor. it might be the leading factor. so that's the kind of defensive reason. 

 it's like life insurance for life collectively, and so, you know, not just for humans, but all like the creatures that we love. so, um, that's like the defense you're gonna pull like a noah's ark vibe and bring like animals too. yeah, yeah, i mean sure, absolutely, oh, wow, what do you think mars is gonna look like. well, long term, we could make it look like earth, or we have to warm it up, but there's a lot of, um, it's a lot of ice on mars. 

 this looks cold. so, like you just have to warm it up to have liquid water, um, but mars has a. mars would have, um, an, an ocean of, i think, about a roughly, maybe a mile deep, uh, on 40 of the planet. roughly, wow, um, yeah, so if you've watched warming up, so that's a lot of water, all ice right now, precise, 40 of the planet. 

 that is crazy, just isis. in fact, a lot of the ice that you see on mars at the poles is actually, uh, dry ice. it's a co2, frozen co2.. there's this massive amounts of isobars like no little. 

 it's a crazy amount. well, how would you warm it up then. well, you could use like solar reflectors, or you could just create artificial suns with uh, a series of uh, like thermonuclear explosions. um, like this, the sun is like a, a, uh, a giant. you'd create a sun thermonuclear reactor- it's, it's a like. if you want to, if you're worried about like, well, will that generate like dangerous radiation. we'll have you stood in front of the sun if you, you know, just go out in the sun. sure, the sun is uh, it's a, through a nuclear reactor. 

 so that's what you think. so obviously, we can stand in front of the sun and not die. it must be nerve-wracking, though, because it's like all tests, yes, so, yes, you could create like a permanent like sun, like by mars. no, you'd have to do it, would it just be like a heat wave and then it's kind of gone and it melts all the ice. oh, so it's big, it's very big. 

 what are those so fascinating. yeah, what are the first steps. like, what do you start with to start civilization on mars. 

 what's the first thing you got to do. um, and then you need a propellant, uh, kind of a propellant factory or propellant plant. so mars's atmosphere is primarily co2, um, and if you, and then if you take water which is h2o, uh and uh, you can turn co2 and h2o into ch4 and o2, which is methane and oxygen. so you that that's why starship uses methane as a fuel. it's, it's mostly oxygen. so it's like 78 oxygen the propellant and 22 fuel. so in, you know, in space, in a vacuum, you have there's no oxygen to burn, so you've got to bring out oxygen and you mostly bring oxygen. so, uh, you'd be, uh, you need a propellant plant to create the liquid oxygen, liquid methane, um and food and water and the basics. 

 essentially that's. that'll be the thing to start off with, um and um you'd be living in kind of like glass domes and posh the underground and stuff. so it'll be hard living in the beginning on mars, like not like a luxury situation. so who are the first people that go live there. 

 i don't know pioneers, um, but i would say the you know any. for for the first people that go to mars, it, it's like it's gonna be like dangerous, like you might die. uh, food, probably not good, um, you know it's gonna be a long and difficult trip. it's, it's like it's probably like a lot of pain and danger. that's that. what do you think about the population. 

 on the other hand, it's going to be glorious adventure. so it sounds like there's got to be something, but i bet you there's still a long list, right. people that want. i think once maybe there's threats to earth, then the list gets huge. right, there's probably a huge list already. yeah, maybe. i mean, i think there's like there's people like climb mount everest and stuff, so you know. or like thrill sale- yeah, sale is cross-specific by themselves, you know, um, so, so there's, i think there's. then there's like you got eight billion people on earth, so you don't only need a small number to want to do it. 

 how much. i'm just saying it's like the beginning. it's going to be like dangerous, difficult and and, uh, you know, um, like not, not like a, it's not like a luxury resort. 

 it can be dangerous and difficult and a lot, a lot of work basically, but you know, over time you can make it awesome. all right, so you're going on the list. i. i wouldn't do mars. i would do space. 

 no chance, i wouldn't do more chance. you would go into space, bro. yeah, i would. no, i would trust elon. 

 what do you mean. so you would go into space and just chill and then come back. yes, i would do it. i wouldn't. i would go to mars, because that's what i'm on. the next. mars is like a commitment. 

 that's like your whole life like. but i would do space. i don't know about that. how do you, how do you. how are you going to filter like the water. if you're going to heat up like mars and stuff like that. well, filtering water is actually not. it's not super hard, you know. you can always just like evaporate it and or use various like carbon filters and stuff. it's it. you can purify water as a well understood uh process, um, so, um. 

 so you just basically go- you have to go- mine some dusty ice and and then uh, melt it and send it through a bunch of water purifiers and you could drink it. yeah, that's crazy. what do you expect the population to be in mars. like i know you said that. i mean, i hope it's a big population at some point. um, what's the number. i know you're a numbers guy. 

 you have to be. well, i i think there's a critical threshold is how many people. how many people i needed on mars for moss to be self-sustaining, such that if the spaceships from earth ever stopped coming the people that it wouldn't die out, you know. and if you're missing any, any element of that, then, um, then if the shifts from earth stopped coming, it would die out. you'd be like if you had everything except vitamin c, um, then yeah, you'll be okay for a while, but then you're gonna eventually die. oh yeah, so you got it there, just can't be any any like missing, critical, missing ingredient. so then it's like: okay, well, how many people are needed to ensure there's no listening ingredient. i don't know, maybe a million people, i'm guessing. um, i was not more than that, um, it's probably not much less than that, and then you probably need millions of tons of cargo delivered to mars. so it's a lot. 

 um, i feel like better. if the, if the, if the universe is really 13.8 billion years old, shouldn't there be aliens everywhere. um, and if not, why not. meaning, if there are no aliens, then what we have here is very rare, and then odds are no aliens is more terrifying. 

 more terrifying, i think it's more likely, though. right, if the universe is 13.8 billion years old. well, this is like. 

 this is why it's called this, like this. this is like a great physicist, enrico fumi, who posed the question of where are the aliens. um, now a lot of people ask me: like, what about the islands. have you seen any evidence of aliens. i've seen no evidence, no hard evidence. what about these pentagon videos. um, like a little, but no, but there are these videos that the pentagon released during covet, of course, but you know like what were. 

 like well, they didn't. they just say that there was ufos, like, that doesn't necessarily mean that the ufo so like. i mean there's like advanced programs that the military has which are classified, and they wouldn't. so, you know, if they had, like, some really fast missile or something, they would. even if somebody else in the military saw that, then they would still not tell them what it was, because it's classified. 

 sure, wait, didn't they release something like. to the best of my knowledge, i have not seen any evidence of aliens, and i think i know why. do you think. i think there's a narrative out there that our first interaction with aliens would be violent. do you think that's the case. well, if so, i think we're in trouble, because if they were able to get here and we couldn't get there, then probably they've got much better technology than well, we're done. yeah, we're told we're at the university. 

 this is so interesting. it does not seem like it's always like going to be violent. one and two, they're more advanced than us, but why can't we. they're going to be way more advanced, not a little bit more advanced. 

 oh, why is that. so we'll be. i would just be totally at their mercy, because if they've got spaceships that can get from other star systems to here- yeah, we don't have anything like that, right, that's true. 

 so wasn't there. probably got some bad ass space lasers and, yeah, like who knows why, you think we have something crazy anti-matter weapons. like, basically, we're hopeless, like we would just be like children or something. you know, maybe we have some area 51, though no, some lasers locked in there. have you been there. um, but you know, there there are. you've been, area weapons. i'm not very r51, um, there are actually lots of areas. by the way, oh, i think spacex technically lisa's area 59 or something like that. 

 so they're numbered. i think i think spacex needs to create some lasers. if so, wait, is there better. we do have space lasers, oh, really, yeah, elon, is there better areas than the 51.. 

 of course, what do you think, please. i don't have one, i need one. how am i going to protect myself if the invasion happens. yeah, let's call elon. 

 oh, yeah, he'll answer. we do have a lot of space lasers. we use them to communicate between the satellites. so, uh, those just there should be. 

 lasers should be fully operational around the end of this year. so were those just rumors or or fake news about eisenhower having meetings with the aliens and like i don't know what year. yeah, i, i do not have meetings with aliens. 

 in fact, i- i think it was. yeah, he's like: watch out aliens. we need more money. yeah, it's like if there was like some scary alien stuff, that would be the fastest way to get the biggest possible. 

 why can't we solve your friends. yeah, but what do you think. we'd react. pretty like people go crazy. 

 like a human population would go crazy, would they. i mean, i, i feel like i don't know, i feel like aliens. the, the general population believes in aliens. i think like 20 years ago everyone's like no, but now it's like if you ask anyone, they're like: yeah, i believe in aliens. 

 yeah, because i meant one. no, but i think everyone just like believes there's aliens because of movies, probably, yeah, of course no, but i saw that on joe's podcast too. it's interesting how in like movies and like since the beginning of time or beginning of entertainment. they've always been like pushing on us like aliens, aliens, aliens like movies, like independence day, yeah, just everything. 

 there's life outside, like earth. that's the other thing. like, why is area 51 so secretive. then i don't think it is actually all that secretive. um, probably, yeah, it, just it just like answered the mythos of and, and i don't know, people got carried away. 

 um, that's i, i. i don't think there's anything sort of super interesting in area 51.. um, like, there are more advanced weapons that the us has that people don't know about, but they're not like crazy alien weapons. so, um, what's your gut feel on if they exist or not. like your gut, obviously there's no hard evidence, but i don't think there are aliens, at least in our sector of the galaxy. 

 to your guts that they don't exist. not in our sector of the galaxy. so there might be aliens in like a far away portion of the galaxy. if, by aliens, i think you mean like with spaceships that could potentially travel to here or something like that. no, just in general, i guess someone alien you could talk to like- or you don't mean like microbes, because that'd be a boring alien. yeah, true, like it's like a tiny like, kind of like just talking, yeah, like a microphone, amiibo, whatever, yeah, plankton, yeah, sure, i guess i guess aliens we could talk to. yeah, so not microbes, not like. 

 yeah, not like. okay, we found a whatever. i mean, what's the first thing that would just ruin it, like we found aliens and here they are. 

 what's the first thing you would say if you're seeing it like face to face, what's the first thing you'd say to alien: uh, welcome, i hope you come in peace, come. do you understand english. or do i does this. oh, just speaking gibberish here, or what, um, um, i'm saying, if they can understand english, then they will have been observing us for a long time, you know. but anyway, i don't think they're. like i said i, i don't think they're aliens, i think the most. but you should view these things as like probabilities generally. you should think of things as probabilities, not certainties. that's the theory i saw. but it's kind of interesting when you think about that, like what if humans are the only thing. yeah, they want us to make us feel like we're not feel small. we wouldn't be smart enough. 

 yeah, like you ain't. yeah, it is well, i mean, based on everything we know about history and archaeology and stuff you know. so earth's about four and a half billion years old and the first writing is only about 5 000 years old. 

 that's basically practically yesterday. so so it's taking 4.5 billion years to get to this point. while the window of opportunity is open, we should make life multiplanetary. what do you think's the biggest threat to mankind right now. i'd say the biggest threat right now is population collapse. the super low growth rate really. yeah, over like nuclear war, naturally, don't. we have an overpopulation problem. 

 no, we have an underpopulation problem, really, yeah, why. why do those are the most commonly misunderstood situation. yeah, they definitely push that. we have a overview. yeah, no, no, we, i don't know, it's just like. 

 i think it's like. this is a holdover from, like i don't know, the 70s or something you know. so there was a huge, um baby boom, like, where people did have a ton of kids after world war ii, but then the us has actually been at. the growth rate in the us has been below replacement rate since like 71 or 72.. in the us, how about other countries- um, well, like china's- got a huge population collapse problem. really, yeah, china, china, you actually get penalized if you have one kid. 

 no, you're see, this is like. so part of it is just like we were operating on things that were true in the past but are no longer true. so china did have a one child policy but, um, like about 10 years ago, that ago, they changed it to a two child policy. then a few years ago they changed it to a three-child policy and birth rate kept plummeting the whole time- lowest growth rate ever last year, really. yeah, china's birth rate right now is 40 below replacement traditional women. i don't wanna, you know. you know one can speculate us to the reasons, but there's no hoes. 

 i mean, like andrew tate was last week, bro, i know, it's true, bro, like what you said about birth, they're out there. see that. wow, that is a very common misconception. i would understand very coherent misconception. what we face, uh, is population collapse, collapse, like you have no idea how fast the population is going to collapse. 

 um, what are we doing. japan is pretty far along in that. like japan actually, uh lost like 600.. 

 that went down by 600, 000 people last year. the japanese are not in the bedroom at all. then it was not at all. 

 it would seem not. what about. what about the us. we got to increase, right, yeah, i'm going to say, is the. the us has been below replacement rates for 50 years. the only reason the population is increasing, like since the 70s, yeah, since the early 70s, since like 71-72.. so why are we spewed with all this bs that, yo, we're overpopulating but the population's growing right. 

 no, it's not. um, so i mean, i should say the, the, the like lifespan is increasing, people are living longer. that's the only reason why the population of earth isn't plummeting, but it will plummet. so, um, you know, just like, one thing to metric, to track is the ratio of adult diapers to baby divers. like, at what point does a country have more adult diapers and baby diapers. and like, japan went past that point over 10 years ago, i believe. whoa, what do you think happens in like the future then. what's your kind of thought on that. well, i think, people, really we've got to turn this around. 

 we're going to have at least replacement rate, if not more, on the baby front. um, and, by the way, these- this is these- are not matters that are, uh, subjective. you can just literally look at the both. you know it's like it's an objective number, like how many kids, babies were born. it's like a. 

 they record this information, you know. so, um and um. so you're saying people need to be having more kids. yeah, i mean, i'm sure you know a lot of people who have like, no kids. like, how many kids do you guys have. i don't know. i got no kids. 

 i mean, now we know what. none of you guys, what the i'm 28,, but i mean i'm 20.. i, i'm trying to get a baby mama soon, but yeah, yeah, and i just got married last month. 

 she's over there, okay, hey, congrats. um, i feel like that's kind of changing though. i think, like, with generations, our generation is have like less marriages, less kids, child support. man, a lot of guys are scared right now. that's true, that's not true, but yeah, i mean it's true. man, i would be scared too. i mean that is that it probably is a big thing. 

 yeah, give me a break. social media too. people get caught up on social media instead of going out and, you know, having fun. how detrimental is that. 

 like what's, what's that if we. if it keeps trending this way, how long does it happen before it's like- yeah, i guess, distinct. well, it it's, it's a, it's a like a low birth rate is is a slow death for a civilization. 

 it's not a fast. yeah, we're chilling for a bit. yeah, i mean career cruising. it's just like the average age just starts drifting up and then you know, basically, civilization will die with a whimper in adult diapers. you know it kind of sucks, doesn't it. it's like anticlimactic, you know, it's not exactly. i mean, frankly, if you say, given the choice, like, i'd rather civilization died with a went out with a bang than a whimper in adult diapers, yeah, what's a bang. 

 bang with world war three. yeah, the choices are, you know, like, it's just like sad or it's just sad if, just if you just die and you know diet, civilization dies of old age. i think, um, so that's like the, the most, that's probably the biggest myth that exists right now is this overpopulation myth, when in fact, we have a population collapse problem. 

 um, and i think people can see this anecdotally when they talk to friends and, just like we just said, like none of you guys have kids yet. it's totally understandable: 20, but i mean 28,, yeah, 28 maybe, yeah, um, how old are you. 42. 2042, you should. 

 he's not contributing, see, like by 42, you should have. no, yeah, what the. and i'm, i'm the problem. 

 i know that's what i got out of this. i think that's the biggest risk to a civilization right now. it's just we- we got to get rid of this nonsense that we're having an overpopulation issue. we have an under population. 

 why do you think that that's not being said more than if that's a huge problem- different agenda. yeah, that's an environmentalist. yeah, well, it's kind of like the. yeah, yeah, i mean like a lot of these things. it's like i'm understood. i don't think it's like some sort of like, like sort of nefarious mastermind situation. 

 it's just a like a dumb idea that hasn't been fixed, you know, as opposed to like somebody's masterminding it or something you know. um, yeah, but i'm just saying objectively, one way or another, if we don't have kids is like population's going to decline, we're going to average age is going to increase. um, when did you have your first child. um, when i was 29,, 29.. wow, how many kids. uh, nine, right, yeah, nine children. well, how many baby mothers. three, wow, wow, um, how old are the twins. now, that's who i met. 

 i met the twins. they're 18.. they're 18 now. 

 wow, yeah, go to college. oh, wow, that's what's the oldest and youngest. well, young, it's just a baby, but um, less than one. 

 uh, the oldest of 18.. nice, so, you know, trying to set a good example here, having a lot of kids, what's it like when they get to the age like 14.. yeah, uh, well, teenagers, like kids generally, um, want to hang out with their parents until they start hitting their, you know, like 13,, 14.. by age 16,, you know, kid, they don't want to hang out with their dad. 

 yeah, that much anyway. yeah, so, um, 18, they definitely don't hang out with their parents. yeah, like, what time do you wake up. yeah, what time do you wake up. when do you make your coffee. maybe you drink coffee, maybe you don't. 

 i do drink coffee. so, nine, nine, thirty, um and um, i, i have a bad habit, which i suspect a lot of people do, of like immediately checking my phone for right away. yeah, right away. 

 yeah, it's a terrible habit actually. um, just see, like any emergencies happen overnight, or no, um, so i didn't want to text you too early this morning. i was like i felt bad texting you. 

 yeah, i was like, all right, i'm gonna wait till after 12 at least. yeah, um, well, i got a lot going on running spacex and tesla and you know. so there's usually some kind of thing that's happened overnight, um, but i think i want to change that to, uh, like i got to work out and be in better shape, you know. 

 so, um, we need you around. oh, thanks, i actually don't really like working out, but, um, i gotta do it. so i'm gonna switch from, you know, just immediately looking at my phone, first thing i'm more as soon as i wake up to i don't know it's working out for at least 20 minutes. and then, looking at my phone, have you ever tried pre-workout. like what's the pre-workout. it's like the like a powder, it's got caffeine in it and like it's usually. sometimes when i'm lazy like this, i just feel like, okay, you should just, you gotta get pre-workout. 

 where's it available. feel like, okay, we have ours too. no, but the bedside pre is a key, because you're so like you can't do anything but go to the gym. you can't sit still, you're just going to go in like a little energy drink. 

 okay, we have one, and ours is all natural too. all right, boys sort of interrupt this pod. i know this is crazy, elon, it's fire, but the pod is not sponsored by anyone. manscape, you're not sponsoring the pod. liquid iv- you suck. you're not sponsoring the pod. pod is sponsored by us. if you guys didn't know, we launched our supplements recently. 

 they're available now on supplementscom. we got our protein: the best and most fire tasting protein. like. 

 it tastes like a milkshake, but it's healthy. we got the creatine. summer's almost over. it's time to start bulking the best and cleanest creatine in the game. and then we got our pre. i personally love our pre. it's perfect for me. it's sustainable. it's a pre that you're never going to be able to stop taking it. never like gets you to that point where you feel like you have to go to the hospital like other pre-workouts. but i got you guys on a discount code- use code podcast15 on supplementscom and you get 15 off your order. 

 so get a subscription, get the shipped to your door every month. let's get back into the pod. elon, i wonder, with your influence, do you feel as if you have- i don't know how to say it- like. do you. do you feel like you have more influence than the government at times. like, do you feel like you can kind of some way take over it. i mean, if you were an american citizen, you would win presidency by a landslide. yeah, you know that you say the nicest things. 

 no, but it's fact. but also, how many. how many twitter followers does joe biden have. do we know, i don't know, but you have. you have a lot more than just checks. 

 i'll check. i think he's got like 20 minutes up his tweets a little bit. you know, yeah, he needs her. i wonder, though, like, when you're, like, sitting at the house, do you ever feel like man, i have way more influence than what the government has. like, you know what i mean. um, well, it's pretty fair to say that i- i, i don't have a lot of influence. 

 34.8, um, what. yeah, well, you've got a. you've got a bigger reach then, because you almost, i think you have 100 million on twitter, right, yeah, the president has 34 million. yeah, so you're getting to more people than he is, which is pretty crazy to think about. it is crazy. yeah, i want to know, i want to know how, how do you feel about that. i was like might be 90 bucks, though you buying followers or elon, you said we can't go there. 

 we're not going there. no, what. i don't know this. i think that that there's there's a fair number of bosses. 

 i've never bought followers or anything but um, but this will, i might. my, my account gets targeted a lot by scammers because you know, um, like my account, is by far the most interacted with account on on twitter. so, um, so, you know, since my account is most interactive with account on the whole system, uh, that's kind of what scammers are going to target my account, you know. yeah, yeah, that's, that's all about the internet. what about the coin. the elon coin. wasn't there elon coin. 

 that just blew up too. yeah, i mean, i don't know, there's like everything. coin, um, what do you think about- not really anymore, though, that coin phase, kind of no, but it was actually this one- like took off, i mean it still trades. well, i think. i haven't looked in a while, but, yeah, well, i have nothing to do with it. 

 i bought a lot because i thought it was yours. but the man, what do you think of the crypto right now. the future- bitcoin, ethereum- the big ones you love. 

 doge. but what's the potential with it. um, why do you think. um, and the fact that there's five billion dollars created every year, um, is is actually, i think, good for using it as as a transactional currency. um, because it. 

 where is it used as a transactional currency. when you buy, like tesla, merch and spacex merch with doge, oh nice. and and you can also pay for boring company rides in vegas, you pay for what. like boring company has uh, tunnels under vegas, what. yeah, i know boring company with the flamethrower, but i didn't know they had underground tunnels like that. that's molly was see what it does. 

 so what. you save time with traffic. yeah, the flamethrower was smart to get stuck on the strip and traffic and they're live available to use right now. yeah, just opened the one from like resorts world, so there's tunnels under vacation. you gotta rip that, yeah. yeah, well, tesla's only right, all right, yeah, it's like tesla's gonna tunnel. 

 basically, yeah, what the. yeah, so you can, but you own a tesla with those. yeah, one's a tesla, tesla. 

 yeah, i love your car, by the way. yeah, who's your biggest enemy right now. yeah, who is your base. 

 i don't know. well, i, i, i, i did challenge vladimir putin to uh, one-on-one, uh, you know, single combat, what. like, i'm not sure he's my biggest enemy, but he, i did challenge him to this one. what does that mean. single combat, mma. yeah, oh, really, we could help with that. 

 dana white, dana white, joe rogan commentating the pay-per-view. i think it would be an interesting question, because he's like good at martial odds. you guys would have time to train too. he's pretty buff, i don't know. so you see those pictures of him on a horse and stuff. i mean putin, i don't. those russians are tough man. yeah, what's your skill set. i'm not doubting you, but like i'd be, i'd be trying to be like, i don't know, look at those arms. i, i, i do have a bit of a weight advantage, but what's your game plan. in the octagon, though, yeah, are you like a ground guy or like i think you're a striker. 

 you got to use your reach. you're a striker, maybe, but what would your game plan be against putin. would you take him out. he said, like he has like one judo championships and stuff. 

 so, oh, she's pretty dude's pretty good. but i, i think i'm probably 50 percent higher than him. so, um, i, i could, um, you know, kick him in the nuts, just kick him. yeah, i mean, if you've got a big weight advantage, um, that that can overcome a lot of technique, you know. but i was like, let me explain to you why. 

 there are weight classes in mma. i'm going to use a, a move called the wall rust, where i just lie on you and you can't get away, you just like suffocate. you said you try that on the wall. 

 you just i'm and you're stuck. i'm gonna try that on steiny, yeah, yeah, well, that will win if you have size on him. in a way, i'm elaine, you're putin, yeah, if you're happy, advantage, just use them. 

 unless you and gabriel have to try that. they're just kind of you just lie on them and said that's the whole move you ever been-. well, you see joe rogan saying that right now he's got him in the walrus- you ever been in a fight. like, yeah, what was the last fight you've been in. um, someone talking was a bar fight. things were very violent. so i wasn't. i mean i never. 

 i never started a flight or anything. but i had a lot of fights. i didn't want to be in um and i got beaten up really badly in a few of them. actually. so, um, but, uh, so i've been in like real hardcore street fights. 

 really. what age. uh, i don't know from when, i was maybe six to 16 ish. well, like people picking on you and or, yeah, um, i grew up in south africa. 

 it's a very violent place. so you think that's what motivated you to become what you are. i mean maybe played a role, certainly toughen you up, that's for sure. i mean the people say like, um, you know they're worried about words and stuff. people are worried about words. 

 it's never been punched in the face. i'd say you're punching the face real hard right on the nose, man, you'll take any words rather than that. you know, yeah, were you more quiet, like back then, 6 to 16.. yeah, i mean, i was uh, i was bookish, you know. so i was like small relatively speaking. it was like the youngest kid in the grade. i was like almost the smallest kid in the grade. 

 so being small and and having some having violent bullies is a bad situation. then the walrus came out and knocked the guy out. damn, oh, wow, yeah, wow, elon, do you watch like a lot of ufc. 

 yeah, it's actually not that. if you want one hot punch in the face- you're not a guy with bear face, no problem. my guy: yeah, yeah, bam, you watch ufc. he said you watch a lot of ufc. 

 yeah, i wish you received from, like you know, the i i don't. i mean i watched ufc occasionally these days. i watched the, the early uh fights with joyce gracie, which was, oh, that show was crazy, yeah, crazy. that was like they didn't have any rules. basically, i mean they had technically had some rules because you know, you kind of like eye gouging, kneecaps or throat. you know they have the same thing. if you really want to take someone out, just punch them in the throat. you know that this is a game over um pokemon, or knock their kneecap off. 

 you still watch now. so i, i, i see the occasional ones, um and uh, i mean there's a lot more more. it's still, you know, interesting to watch, but there's a lot more technique and yeah, um, but you know, these days they have like like weight categories. yeah, because if, if you have some, you know, 300 pound guy go against 100 pound guys, it's not going to be a contest. we go to a lot of fights. we're good friends with dana white, the, okay, yeah, so we, we love ufc, yeah, and we're partners with one of the fighters, sugarshawn o'malley. yeah, i mean it's. 

 it's pretty well seeing these fights. i mean it's a tough gig, you know it is tough gig. yeah, some of the injuries are gnarly. you know like i'll break a or something like that and just have a floppy leg or the long version for like brain effects too. like i have to say it's, it's, yeah, um, like i know a lot about brains actually and you you really don't want to take a hard hit, like a bunch of hard hits. like your brain's like kind of like jello, it's like jello in a coconut, like your skull is a hard coconut and uh, and your brain is like a. 

 it's like it basically has like the consistency of jello, um, really. so, yeah, the thing that damages you is actually the brain, hitting the sides, hitting the side of your skull, because skull's real hard. so this is actually technically something called the subarachnoid space, which is like the air, the area between your brain and uh, and this goes crazy. so the guys, the guys in the nfl, the cte thing's real huh, yeah, yeah, i mean just any kind of heart, like a real fast jerk. acceleration, um is get your. your brain is going to get damaged up against your skull. 

 how bad it is. how bad is a concussion- just one concussion- hawaiian concussion is probably okay- one, yeah, if it's not too crazy. so you smash, you smash your brain against your skull internally, just due to fast acceleration, you're going to lose some number of neurons. now, if you keep doing that, you're going to lose enough neurons to make a difference. your brain can handle a lot of neuron signs, but if you lose enough certain points, you're going to start, uh, losing mental capability. what does that do to you. oh, just, you lose your ability to think. you know, you see that with a lot of nfl players i know it's like: what about. what about the neurolingual brain chip. talk a little bit about that. yeah, so the neural brain chip can, can help with brain injuries. 

 um, that's like that's the first thing we're trying to get done. and and then we think it's actually possible to create like a neural shunt between. either you could you could have full body reanimation. i thought the neural link downloads information, though too right, like can you learn- like i don't know too much about it, but can you learn a whole language from a knurling chip. i mean down the road, i think probably. yes, we're still like neural link, version one, which is very basic. 

 yeah, think of it like a very early cell phone, sure, uh, versus current cell phones. do you ever worry, though, that at some point that's just gonna make all humans like at the same ability. if everybody has a neural link, they will actually even out ability. yeah, i mean. 

 but bear in mind, like you'll be able to see this coming, it's not going to happen like suddenly. so we haven't even had put one in in one human yet. so we're hoping to do that maybe end of this year, early next, in a real human. yeah, yeah, wow, holy man, i mean we already have it's working in monkeys. like we've got like a monkey that can play pong with a song. 

 i've seen that they can play what. like a monkey that that can play pong, like just by thinking, like just it's not touching control or anything, it's like playing. so they made the monkey play ping-pong, like with the mouse, and then they stopped working. 

 the video, a video game, oh, okay, yeah, video game, wow. so that's the most first. first of all, i think most people don't realize monkeys can play pong. so step one: monkeys can play pong. um, then um. so you train the monkey to play pong and you know, you give it like, basically it just has like a banana smoothie. uh, that can every time it. it, you know, hits the ball using the joystick. it gets a little simple on the banana smoothie, wow, um and uh, so then. um, and then, uh, see, so you can see, when the monkey's moving the joystick up or down, what you're getting, a certain neural output from the neural neural link device. then, um, then you disconnect the joysticks. 

 the monkey's still moving the joystick, but joe, joyce is not connected anymore. that's crazy. how long ago was that. 

 that was like a year ago, i think. is there gonna be a point where the neural link can teach a monkey how to speak english. that'd be so insane. 

 we're getting some planet out of the atrium. yeah, i mean, let's make some genius monkey and it's gonna take over the world. could you, don't you want to do that or like that, uh, rick and morty episode where they give the dog. i just thought i should rewatch some of those episodes you seen. curb your enthusiasm. uh, yeah, a fan of that. 

 oh, yeah, that's not bad. um, breaking bad. uh, breaking bad is great. better, call saul. uh, yeah, i watched a couple seasons. 

 yeah, i couldn't get into house cars that much. um, narcos, uh, viki vikings and uh, oh yeah, last kingdom were pretty good. yeah, i haven't seen that. 

 i heard that's good. yeah, vampire diaries- i haven't seen that office. i've seen some episodes of the office. do you like that dry humor stuff. i mean, i thought the office is not bad. i, i didn't find it like a like i was really dying to see more. um, office space. no, i haven't. 

 office space is great space. oh, of course, the movie. yeah, yeah, great, great movie, cute classic. yeah, you guys see that. yeah, it's a class. why do you like that. 

 though it's just the driving right, i think you're dry humans. it's very funny. try humor. it's a guy that works in nine to five. 

 look at elon's twitter. like dry humor. yeah, it's funny. yeah, i know it's really funny. uh, i like, i like mark judge's humor in general. 

 yeah, i'm like: judge great, leave this in butthead. but with the neuralink, do you. what do you think. like, do you think there's anything ever. do you think that could go wrong with it. like what if. what if it could ever go wrong. what if the government. no, i mean, what if the government got involved in, like neuralink. well, i think so. then that would be a huge life changer, you know, so that the reward would be worth the risk. 

 yeah, this was like they're never getting jesus level stuff. you know, seriously, is this all you're thinking about. uh, because you say you go to sleep at three am, is what you think about, like late at night, like i wonder what goes on. yeah, sometimes, uh, i'm most of my thinking uh is, uh, like uh is on spacex and tesla, so that that absorbs the vast majority of how do you say. link is to me even like almost more interesting than space. like that is insane, it's so cool. i think it's kind of scary too, but it is very, because how advanced can you make humans. and then it's like no one, there's no differentiator. if, like, everybody can be the same level of intelligence, we'd be superhuman at that point. right, we would be super. 

 he'd have to answer to anything. like in order to get learn something you'd have to go to a library, and if you didn't have access to the library then you couldn't have access to information. but now anyone you know in the world with like 100 phone and like internet cafe can access all the information you know, learn anything, essentially. so the internet is a great leveler for information and education. 

 you can just learn anything online for basically for free. do you see neurolink as, like, one day everyone will have one, or or would it only be for people that have, like disabilities. no, i think so we're just starting off with, like i said, like long-term vision. yeah, yeah. 

 like you know, being able to use a phone versus not use a phone, you're having your. you know, be able to walk or not walk is a big, big reward. so that's how we'll start off. we could like literally change the setting in your brain and and to internal hunger, uh, which would be pretty, pretty, pretty cool. um, you know, if somebody's got like serious depression to the point where they're like suicidal, if you could fix, yeah, fine, sure, why not, the benefits are huge. or just getting out of cancer, uh, we did. 

 we have a banana flavor that we're sampling and we put our board ape on there. okay, do you just like trolling. yeah, i love trolling. yeah, trolling rocks. 

 yeah, so, you know, i mean, that's dope if you can get, like you know, 100 000 likes like that on twitter. you just troll people. you know who else likes to troll. 

 do you ever respond to haters at all. yeah, you went in with aoc a little bit. right, you went after her. well, yeah, i mean, i don't know. 

 you went at aoc. she started it. you know what, what was that about. she was like coming after me and like i don't know some, i don't know what pissed her off. you know, wait, what, what was that situation. i don't know. 

 i thought she was like i don't know it's attacking me or something. i don't know what it was. but but then i was like, well, okay, why don't we have a paul and see, who do you prefer. and i was like um, and i was like, well, you're a politician, you know people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. and then, and then i and then i hold a poll like, okay, which one do you. 

 uh, i don't know, uh, like more about politicians, of billionaires and they're like bolino's, worn by a lot, you know. so i was like, okay, take that aoc, um, and. and then, and then, like some, some, someone who was like super pro aoc ran a direct poll of like, uh, you know, who do you like more aoc or elon musk expecting, like aoc to win. oh my god, like the uh meme mma. you know, you, walrister on the pulse, why you. 

 you knew you were gonna win by like a large no, i mean, i don't know for sure. you knew my favorite billionaires. she's popular. she got a lot of you know, she got a lot of fans. um, she does. she has a die hard following. 

 yeah, she's not about following you. selene doesn't know who she is, but i think you'd like her. i don't really know she's much about her. no, no, no, no, not her politics. i think you'd think she's. she's attractive. oh, you know what she is. okay, yeah, she's all right, she's right. yeah, great choice of lipstick. i think, great taste in lipstick, because i mean, that's my absolute, genuine compliment. were you always like publicly more like conservative. 

 i feel like that's something a little more recent. am i conservative or just like. i mean no, no, like conservative. well, you're like a billionaire. that even even i mean. what does that mean. 

 anyway, i've heard that. well, supporting conservatives like desantis and stuff like that. i think jose is like, i don't know. he seems like he'd be doing a good job in florida. you know he wasn't. he's doing his dope, he's doing an amazing job. yeah, definitely a lot of pressure. you know, um, we don't want, like a big brother situation where the, the government's, just, like you know, busting people around um and um, you know. 

 so, um, we should make sure, like you know, freedom in america is preserved. you know, the craziest thing to me too: how come tesla, for instance, is so dominant in the electric car space. because, i know, you know, fisker, nicola, all these others, but they can't compete like at any level. 

 like, why are you so far ahead of all these guys. is fisker even a thing. yeah, i'm trying, he's on his second go. 

 henry fisker. well, the hard problem is not making a prototype. the hard problem is is making the factory. 

 so the factory is like 100 times, maybe a thousand times, hotter than the prototype. so, um, and that's why i'm like working here. i mean, i was in the tesla factory friday, saturday and sunday. 

 you said you're there. i was there literally this past friday, saturday, sunday in the factory, um, all weekend basically. um, and uh, yeah, because we're working on bringing up the factory, it's really hard to do production. so that the issue is is like, prototypes are easy, production is hard. you've got to have this giant factory which is like the cybernetic collective, you know, with 10 000 things that can go wrong and you've got to solve them all really fast. if you're on solar problems, fast enough factory doesn't go, and if- and you've got some big factory, it's going to burn money like crazy if you can't make product. 

 so, like, manufacturing is underrated, um, it's really hard. well, do you worry about the competition or you like it. i'm not worried about the competition, not, not from the standpoint of like, oh hey, that it's just not a thing. 

 it's not a like out till. success or failure will not be because of competition. it's like, do we make a high quality product at a price people can afford. and i kind of kind of feel guilty right now, like our prices are kind of high, you know, um, because we also just don't know where inflation's headed. but sure inflation's like because, like the waitlist for so for some tesla, depending on which model it is, could be like up to a year. 

 so then if you're like, okay, well, you need to move up on that, yeah, yeah. and if like, yeah, if your inflation is nine percent, well we better increase, have prices. for you know, if a car sold today delivered in a year, we have to anticipate the inflation. so, like, like our, frankly, our prices are embarrassingly high right now. so i'm hoping inflation goes down. so that's like a positive sign on the inflation front. um, but we'll see. 

 it's a little too early to tell. is there anything you can share on the cyber truck updates. yeah, yeah, um, so we expect to be in volume production of cyber truck next year. so it's, it's, it's a, since it's like, like a radically different architecture from any other car. uh, it's. it's quite difficult to figure out how to make it. 

 you know, because it's not. you can't just use prior techniques to make actually cyber truck. you have to invent a whole new set of manufacturing techniques for the cyber truck. so, um, but i think at this point we feel like we've got a handle on all the issues and, um, we expect to start delivering them by the middle of next year. we need like 20 of them. we want to. this is our alcohol, yeah, and we want to wrap them in happy dad. we're going to make them more delivery. i think it's a sick product. 

 i mean, it's great. how many people are on that. all happy dad delivery channels- 2020 of them- and we'll be all wrapped happy dad. 

 people will instagram them like. the thing about star trek is going to change the whole look of the roads. we're happy to play. how. 

 so we're happy to play. it just looks radical. it's just, uh, like, the whole aesthetic is just. it looks like cgi in real life, like even when you're standing right next to it. i mean, imagine picking up a girl on a cyber truck. 

 yeah, that would be the ultimate. like it's pretty much the hard work's done, like the second she gets in the car it's just kind of like over. you know, my tesla now, my tesla now we're repopulating. you know it does well, it's military green, does well, woody, what did you pull up in. okay, what tesla do you. what's your everyday driving. and so, uh, since i have kids, that's like these four doors and stuff. 

 you know we need to be able to put the kid's seat somewhere, but i also wanted to be really good with handling and acceleration. what do you have. you have a model. 

 i have the model that's 2021.. yeah, yeah, what else is the same. i like the car. i mean it's, it's, it's just, it's like a perfect car, like that. that's great. i mean it's like nice. 

 i mean i got to watch. what else would you want unless you're- that's what i agree- mastered right, this guy hits the charging stations way too long, too much. yeah, supercharger man, hey, yeah, getting all that money part of our content. one of our guys- steve, the one who lost his youtube channel- is giving away teslas. 

 he's giving away. i think he's bought 12. 12 teslas in the last year and a half. yeah, tesla, it's cliche, but teslas are amazing. 

 no, they're nice. yeah, what about solar panels. like, what's the future on that. i think solar will be the single biggest source of energy in the world. um, so, um, it tells us there's quite a lot of solar and it's growing. 

 it's growing fast. so, solar cities, you as well. uh, well, soul city was acquired by tesla, but then we, we retired the solar city brand and now it's just tesla, tesla. 

 okay, yeah, um, well, there's still like, a lot of houses that were installed with solar city and stuff. um and uh, and then, uh, electric vehicles, and then you got a fully sustainable future. so the the real value of tesla is accelerating the advent of sustainability. it's like, uh, that, that's like. it's like what, what's. what is the real value of tesla to civilization. 

 it will be accelerating sustainability by 10 years, maybe 20 years. wow, yeah, did you use autopilot. what's that. oh, yeah, you use it. yeah, but you know i do like autopilot, but i do like to, yeah, just have my hands. oh, i use autopilot because i'll go from la to oc. 

 yeah, which one. yeah, well, that's it nothing. right, you're supposed to be in your phone, but but the with the, but, like sorry, autopilot is awesome. it's amazing because, like in traffic, you, you don't have any opportunity. like, yeah, yeah, you know, autopilot has changed my life straight up. well, yeah, well, not, not that i don't trust you or anything, but i just have to have my hand on the wheel. 

 you know, i'm being very honest. i mean, like you know, you hear the beep. that's the best thing i'm going to tell you about the tesla. 

 that i've noticed is the autopilot feature just changes the game for anybody. yeah, it's, if you're interested in, if you're commuting in traffic. it's amazing, especially in la. 

 yeah, i love the piano and the fire. yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, and you know what you do. it's like- i took a check too- the honks are crazy too. how do you do that. you just come up with that. you can fart if you honk the car. yeah, yeah, i've used that. i have that on my car. yeah, yeah, there's like there's an internal at fart app where you can make a fart sound like it's coming from any seat in the vehicle. so you know, it's like just using like spatial audio. so, uh, like, and people aren't expecting that, you know, yeah, i use it when people are walking across. 

 i know who came up with that idea. there's like a dive, like you can the horn can make a fart sound, so you can like just fart at people. yeah, yeah, yeah, i don't know. and then the internal fart one is: you can, you can have different fart sounds and like, but you can pick which seat it's it's coming from. yeah, yeah, yeah, the bat, yeah, yeah, so you so like, or someone doesn't know that's this exists, uh, that you can really play mess with them. you know, because they're just not expecting it. like you can say like the fart sound should come from the right rear seat, um, and the speakers will just produce it from there. 

 and i feel like, well, no, even using it outside, like when i use it on people, like sometimes just around and i just i honk and stuff people. usually i would expect them to give you: yeah, it's funny, though that's the one thing. though, if you want to honk at somebody and you fart at him, i don't know if it's as like yo, you cut me off, like yo, dude, you cut me off, but i mean it's funny. they're probably laughing. it's. it's kind of funny. 

 you know, he likes the road rage. yeah, you can also like make the sort of the the car can. um, uh, the external speaker can like when you're just cruising around a parking lot or something, uh, you can make it play like, um, you know, polynesian elevator music. or like snake jazz, um, or you can make it like play the coconut sound from monty python. 

 so it's like club, club, club sounds like cohorts. it's a pretty sick. any, any other features you haven't tapped into. 

 you want to launch. um, i mean, we always like little, little things that here and there. um, there's a whole bunch of easter eggs in the car which i think people found, almost all of them online. uh, easter eggs, yeah, easter eggs mean like like little things, mystery things you gotta discover yourself. 

 yeah, just go to yourself. or technically, you just, you know, google it away. yeah, anything, anything anybody hasn't discovered. uh, not that i know, um, but sometimes there's like things like the guys don't tell me they're in there. 

 yeah, oh, wow, you know, found out, so i like it. only recently i i found that voice command open butthole. um will open the chargeboard door. 

 you tweeted that, yeah, we'll open it up a couple of days ago. if you use voicemail, open butthole, then the charge four door opens. wow, yeah, is there a supercharger. 

 is there a supercharger for the house. i saw that it's just crazy because nobody else would like something like this. yeah, i know, well, no other car companies have no sense of humor. no, it's like they're super serious. no, fun, they're fun. yeah, yeah, i mean i'll go with the tails like what's the most amount of fun you can have in a car, basically, and the thing like why, why don't you do that. you know, hell, yeah, yeah, that's such a rare quality you have you on is that you're such a smart guy, but you're also, like you know, to relate to the, to the people. 

 yeah, well, i mean i just like i think what's the thing that i don't want. like the car, that's the most fun, you know. so, yeah, you definitely have comedy in you. 

 yeah, i love comedy, so i stand up as my side house. well, yeah, do you have superchargers. do you have superchargers for the house, or is it just. i know i just used charges. well, we gotta get supercharger in the house. man, i'm tired of going to those tesla's supercharging places. man, it's like that's what you just need: a regular, you know, regular wool charger. 

 yeah, is all you need. that's true. yeah, um, he's the guy that doesn't plug his iphone in it. like you know, i'm saying i'm always there. yeah, i will tell you that i've been on zero miles for at least 20 minutes on the road and i've gotten to a supercharger. 

 so thank you for that. like i don't know. yeah, i mean it does have more miles than it says. 

 when it says zero, it actually got more, a few more miles left. um so, um, yeah, um so, yeah, the more more fun stuff coming down the road. um, we're actually just, uh, we're trying to get like, uh, steam working on tesla's so like you can play. if once we get steam working, then you can play any game that's on on steam on the tesla. 

 oh, really, yeah, that's huge, it's cool. wow, that'd be kind of fun, especially if you get the self-driving thing going. you know like, oh yeah, what are you gonna do. 

 you know like, be on your phone or play a game or watch movies. so then, uh, it's crazy. it's funny because people always say, yo, i fell asleep, but i had the autopilot. yeah, but during the autopilot you have to hold the steering wheel while you're there. well, yeah, what will happen is, if you do fall asleep, then the car will start beeping at you and like, really is going to beep at you real loud if you don't do anything. so let's, wakes you up, it'll, it'll if it'll wake you up. sometimes people are like passed out so much they they don't wake up, but then the car will just gradually slow down and put on the emergency blinkers. 

 wow, that's way better than falling asleep. oh, yeah, autopilot, that's going to crash. you know absolutely, um, i mean, the thing that got me to really, you know, um, giddy up on the autopilot front, was in the early days. um, there was a guy that fell asleep at the wheel on a model s and um, and he ran over cyclists and killed the cyclist. oh, my god, the model s is going to see. uh, well, it was just like you know, this happens all the time. actually, you know, it's like people fall asleep at the wheel and then they like run over. well, isn't that what the model y. you kind of like just fall asleep. 

 i would think the model s is kind of like a downgraded version, right, no model, i'm talking about early model. so we're doing like 20 early, okay, before there was any autopilot. so, um, there was a guy that that fell asleep with the wheel and he, he veered off the road and killed cyclists. 

 oh my god, this happens all the time, you know. so, um and um, i was like man, if we just had autopilot, then that cyclist would still be alive, you know. so it's like we better hurry up with autopilot, get that working. 

 you know so that's nuts, do you feel. do you ever feel like i mean, maybe or maybe not, but do you ever feel guilty when someone is like sleeping behind a wheel and then something bad happens like that. well, i mean now with, uh, with autopilot, that's less likely. and we also have like, um, even if the autopilot's not on, like lane departure warning to just, you know, beep at them which will help wake him up. i mean, you can do that right now with a full self-driving beta. oh, you can. yeah, you don't have to touch the wheel, let them know you're awake or anything. well, you touch the wheel just to confirm that you're paying attention, uh, but, um, the car is capable of doing that, uh, most likely without any intervention. that's insane. 

 we need those asap. yeah, now, as the product matures and we get to very high levels of reliability, then, uh, you know, we'll get to the point where you won't need to touch the wheel or pay attention. you could basically just fall asleep and wake up at your destination. wow, um, that's a mind that's insane. yeah, like jesus christ. how far away from that, in fact. 

 yeah, that's it. yeah, you think we're headed into, like, a big recession. i don't think we're headed into a big recession. um, i'd say like maybe a mild recession, um, but it could be a mild recession that lasts for a couple years, something like that. you know um, but the, the thing that's hard to predict. 

 there is an independent of that. uh, just like the us did in the lead up to 2008,. so in the us lead of 2008,, the us was building primary housing units at twice the rate of household formation. so you, if, you, you know, if, if you're making houses twice as fast as as families are forming, then obviously something's got to give. 

 that's we're doing that in the us for a while, um, and so china's been doing that as well, but even more so that that'll be. that's a correction. that's going to happen. i, i don't think everyone's gonna live in a fifty thousand dollar box. uh, you know, that's not that. you know that's fantastic. 

 i think that's a goal at some point. yeah, how tiny is your house like. how many bedrooms do you have in there. how many square feet is it. 

 i don't know, it's like maybe eight or 900 square feet, like that. what about ai stuff. you ever fear about. a ai revolution, a rebellion. yeah, that is a risk. 

 um, ai is advancing rapidly. that'll be on my risk list. how, how soon do you think that is something gotta worry about. an hour or ten years, probably less than ten years, really. 

 for what. robots ais to attack the human. so necessarily to attack. but if you say, like when is it dangerous. when they become smarter than us. i guess 10 years, i mean, the viewers already were smarter than us in in most ways. but when they know, hey, yeah, we haven't even touched on ai yet, sure, yeah, let's go. i mean, those things could be hacked too. 

 well, that's. i think that's a big fear too, more than aliens, because computers, like you said, are smarter than us. so when do they, when do they become smarter to be like yo, we can take over the world. yeah, computers are already smarter than us in most respects, but but, but do they have that sense of like power like it's. it's ai like it. like does power come from. like being, like human and like like consciousness. 

 like does is an ai necessarily going to like seek that power necessarily, unless it's programmed to do so. oh, yeah, yeah, it feels like even our phones like people are talking all the time. you're talking about a topic and then you get asked: they listen, yeah, they listen. that alone, i think, is kind of like: you see what tick-tock you give access to. 

 no, you give them access to like everything. really, no one reads it. are you on tick-tock. yeah, you're twitter. only i always wondered why no words. yeah, why is that. 

 i mean i only need one means of like communicating to people you know. so, um, do you have a secret ig account, instagram account, that you guys have a secret instagram. of course, we got like zero followers. yeah, i know, it's just. i literally just like i can click on links and stuff. you just like troll people. yeah, you troll people, for sure. i don't know, i don't troll. actually, i haven't trolled you. you have burner accounts, man. no, actually i haven't trolled anybody. i don't have. 

 i feel like that's cap. you have to have to have trolled somebody. durant, even john, like yo, you're kind of a pushy guy, bro, like. no, you know, the crazy thing is i wasn't that pushy. i've never had any twitter account except my own. so why don't you just launch an instagram too. 

 yeah, you'll pop off. um, help us out, man. well, no, i mean, i wasn't instagram for a while, but he can get you verified, yeah, i mean. so the problem is like instagram, man, it's just a thirst trap, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, instagram's next level thirst trap. so, um, on the women's side, right, yeah, yeah, totally, but like, and if you're like, the thing is like, i found myself taking like a lot of selfies and and i'm like, what the man. yeah, why am i doing this. 

 and then i was like, listen this thing. and i'm like, oh, i'm trying to get more likes and and do self selfies. this is, i'm not going to i stagger the instagram models, like they, just, yeah, but you should just make a meme page. 

 yeah, like a jerry type, but edgier, yeah, political. your instagram would be pretty dope, bro, if you just had me on the page. i've only seen one photo of you and that was you next to a computer. that is the only photo i've ever seen of you on instagram. okay, i've never seen any other ones on instagram. yeah, like, i thought it was your actual account, but it wasn't. i guess it was a fake. 

 oh, that's probably a lot of fakes. yeah, as a, of course. yeah, i mean, i, i find, like, you know, there's just, uh, i can, whatever message i'm trying to get across, i can just throw it on twitter and people repost on instagram and stuff. so, yeah, how about snapchat. um, uh, i don't use snapchat. um, do you use snapchat. i have it. 

 do you use it. yeah, okay, for a little bit, like like snap a few girls and then i like i actually like the the stories they have, like this official one's pretty big though. that's like pretty good for your movies actually too. 

 yeah, we got like two million dollars, there's a lot. and then promoting our stuff. snapchat is great too. snap's just for like women, snap slow key like one of the best ways to promote stuff. i find too, yeah, because they don't unfollow you or anything. it's like and you're there forever in our and our on our official page. it's like only our die hards follow it. you know, like random. 

 you don't follow a random person on snapchat- like you got to be a director, but you rarely see somebody on add somebody on snapchat, right. we have we have meetups and thousands and thousands. i mean i think we did one in fort worth, it was like almost five thousand. we shut down texas. wow, yeah, we shut down the helicopter. 

 fort worth pd said: if we show up, we're gonna get arrested for inciting a riot because there's too many people there. wow, that was all promoted on snapchat, like we didn't even really post it anywhere else. we just posted on snapchat and went viral from there. can we promote a launch and have a meet up at a launch. well, it's actually. 

 it's easy to see launches from from florida, because there's a um, you can go get pretty close and we have lunches every week. have you ever had a. oh, have you ever had a show, elon. should i show you. 

 wait, but hold on. have you ever had a violation or any problems like tweet taken down, anything like that. actually, you know, i guess, that, um, i i've put in some some pretty borderline tweets, but no problems. um, they've never. 

 actually they've never taken a, a direct action against me, but i think they might have, like shadow bandit or something. twitter's personal too, i mean same thing, as twitter probably loves having you on, though i think twitter needs elon. i tweeted this one- this is right after we had trump on our podcast. okay, it got like a hundred thousand. what did you say. okay, cool. 

 um, hold on. do you know what your most viral tweet is of all time. like, your most viral like. retweeted likes. what is it. 

 um, it's uh. next i'm gonna buy coca-cola and put the cocaine back that break a million, that way that you, you know. oh, wow, how many likes did that get. 

 yeah, i bet you got a million, though i think you got like four million or something. oh, my god, did it used to happen. you used to have coke on twitter with likes. 

 so, like, getting 4 million likes is insane. did he used to have coconuts. yeah, you're right. yeah, that did you know you cocaine- you said coke, coca-cola. used to have cocaine back in the day. what days was that like. earlier. yeah, i wasn't born like 50.. 

 you have stuff in your dress. that was the most, probably most popular tweet of all time. how long ago. the most popular tweet ever made by a living person. 

 it's amazing. wow, your tweet- the man on twitter- is the second most popular one after chadwick boseman. but that was use ai to predict what tweets are. that may have been what i hit you up for. 

 like that was what triggered for me to call you, and then. then i added, added coca-cola and said: listen, like, listen to the people, you know, does poke this coca-cola. come on, does coca-cola reach out to you. the people are saying: put the cocaine back in. clearly they want it. so, come on, did they reach out to you about that. 

 back to your roots, elon. do you just tweet. do you just tweet whenever, like. you just tweet whenever, like, whenever you feel like it. yeah, pretty much, that's so savage. you're the only guy that has the balls in your position to do that. 

 everybody else, like has a lawyer, gets approved. no, do you have to do whatever you're thinking about right now, like, do you have any in your dress that we could just, yeah, yeah, yeah, what's in this. yes, exactly what's in the dress folder. 

 and i'm like, okay, i'm not saying what they are, but there are a few in the dress folder that that i the next morning, i was like, okay, probably i shouldn't send that. um, so, uh, but it was pretty insane for me to challenge putin to. you know, one-on-one combat. uh, how viral did that go. 

 it went pretty viral and then it even gotten like russian telegram and stuff. and then i got: would you ever take on kim jong-un. i mean, if he wants- i saw you- i'm going to say no, what about a friendly cop. i feel like kim jong-un would be down. i mean, you know if, if he wants, putin's not really about it. i feel like he just chilled out, but he had some people. 

 i remember he tweeted like: yo, if i disappear in the middle of the night, you know where i went. and then i think your mom got involved. right, yeah, yeah, no, i mean, she said that's not funny. yes, you just say that's not funny. um, yeah, i mean like, i don't have an assassination squad, you know. yeah, so you've got to protect yourself. though you got this one. 

 yeah, that's the key differences between. that's the problem, though you don't ever feel scared if you go at russia or kim jong-un. you know i did think like man, this, this could be a really this, this could really backfire and resolve. 

 yeah, yeah, oh yeah, wrestle center. you worry about that. you worry about, like some of these people not understanding your humor and taking it. are you serious. britain doesn't have a great sense of humor. oh, might relax. 

 how do we set this. i don't think he doesn't crack darts that often, but i mean maybe he does behind the scenes. he does for sure. yeah, he's got a secret telegram like. 

 maybe he's got a. it sounds like times you have no fear. you don't fear anybody. i don't have a death wish, right. yeah, i mean, everybody's gonna die, just question when. so how do we create something to keep us alive. i'm not worried about dying. can we create something to keep us alive longer or no. have you looked into that longevity. if that's possible, sure, um, you'd think that'd be a fight. i think i could probably solve some of longevity to some degree. um, but i don't want to. 

 someone's going to do that. so if you want to have progress in society, you got to make sure that. you know people, people need to die because they don't. they get old, they don't change their mind. 

 absolutely. so if, if, if, all children lived for a long, super long time, i think society would get lazy, right, it's very stale, you know, very ossified, pretty crazy. i mean, if you live forever, what the you don't care about tomorrow. 

 yeah, in a way. but also, yeah, older people are stuck in their ways, right, like they've lived their whole life. they're not like all people are stuck in their ways and they don't change their mind, they just die. some people are just ready to die, yeah, when, yeah, i mean good, yeah, lived enough life. 

 i think you sort of you're ready to die. would neurolink be able to save people's memories. like, could you text me down those memories and put it in another person. yeah, sufficiently advanced neural link would be able to save the save state. um, now, you wouldn't be exactly the same person, but you're also not exactly the same person. 

 when you wake up every morning, you're a little different from when you went to sleep. so, especially advanced neural link would would enable you to record and could be like a clone in a different body. so to say, yeah, sufficiently advanced neural link, you could say save game. basically, do you think they've cloned humans. 

 i don't know. i'm not aware of any cloning of humans that has actually taken place. but if you say, is it possible to clone here. it's very possible, right, of course, because they've admitted to cloning sheep, right, well, you can, uh, get your dog cloned right now. yeah, is that like, literally a dog cloning service. 

 where do you do that. so there's got to be clones. there's even advertising for it. like, if you search to clone my job, that's like, that's like, and your cat, that's kind of common. i don't know like it's common to clone your dog. sherivan has a cloned dog, doesn't he. i don't want to quote it, but well, you gotta have ten clones and they'd be like your dog. 

 times sherman has like the most, like dope. that'd be pretty weird. whatever they're called- i don't know if i like that, not pitbulls, but, um, staffordshire, i think they're cloned anyway. you can literally- not not only in the club that they're, they're the top three links- are going to be advertising for cloning your dog or cat. 

 that means there has to be- there's the clone on the planet. well, how much does that cost a dog. you know, maybe not in the us. is it expensive. it's gonna be expensive. it's like 50 grand. 50 grand to clone a dog. that's not even that crazy. i'm doing that. people can afford that. 

 there's people out there that can afford it. that's craig. yeah, i'm gonna get second craig. fifty girls like three cracks. 

 yeah, yeah, renee, what do you think. oh, and they'll just run around. i mean, as long as you have to train them, it might be better. yeah, i mean, if they're already trained to go outside, then clown might be the option. 

 well, you can, literally. i think there's a dog cloning service here in austin. oh my god. yeah, what is going on. that's crazy, that's crazy. and i think it's just. if you can clone a dog, include a human. 

 yeah, same level of difficulty. wow, that's scary. cloning a human, i mean, someone's tested it somewhere, i'd bet. i'd bet my whole bank account. like there's a lot of things that just happened though. 

 bradley martin, i mean, yes, is this really you. right there, you're like, everything does that, but our feelings like chemical, but i guess it's your everything you've ever felt, all your remote, everything. it's all electrical signals, right, whoa, it's all coming. it's all neurons firing. so that's insane. so the clones will have feelings and you could record, record everything. 

 oh my god, that's scary. that's when the ais take over, though, yeah, i'm saying like. so that is like saying, yeah, you could actually even recreate like a video game. that's like the most real vid, like very game where every sense that you feel is you're in the game, like someone, like this, like this could be a neural link video game. but so does that mean if you die in the video game, you done real life type thing. not necessarily, but does your mind convince you of that. 

 well, you could do anything. it could make the brain believe anything, like what you have said. what, what is death. death is the loss of information. 

 so like if, if you, uh, let's, let's say like, like if you got disintegrated but but then got, you know, reintegrated immediately with no pain or anything, did you die. well, not, not really, because you, you're still continuing. so, like you know we're in a video game, you do that, you die a lot in the video games. um, but, but you, then you just come back to a saved game state. 

 yeah, and now. so so you say, like, what is death. what is. what does death actually mean. it's the loss of the information associated with that individual. 

 and if you no longer have lots of information associated with that individual, death has no meaning. i mean it could hurt, i suppose. gta 5-. this is crazy. do you do you play video games. yeah, what do you game. i just played elden ring, which was really great. elton rain- yeah. 

 alvin ring- i've never even heard of that, have you guys already- is amazing. what, uh, console. i play pc. really, what's the game. 

 i'm sorry, i haven't heard of it. elven ring is a great game. uh, it's probably game of the year. um, i'm gonna get roasted by the gaming community. oh, yeah, you're screwed, it's a problem. 

 it's a from software anyway. um, it's like a shooter or it's like a fantasy game. uh, it's awesome game. i highly recommend playing elden ring. well, now, i'm gonna play it. 

 i promise you that's great. it's sick. um, elm ring has the most beautiful art i've ever seen, super advanced. it's just beautiful art. did you grow up artistically. 

 uh, amazing. did you grow up playing like video games. yeah, i grew up playing very prominent video games. um, because i'm like 51, so that's no spring chicken. so, like super smash, nintendo- yeah, super smash i, i played it. i mean, where else. 

 that's primitive to us, but probably not super primitive. yeah, no, i just you know who doesn't play. i was live before there was even pong. sure, i had a console, the console before atari, for the original atari. 

 wow, i only had four games. um, do you ever think you can even add new games. you can, like, play full games. um, so you ever think about creating your own console. no, no, no need for that. what about sports. 

 yeah, um, so there's just no, no challenge there. really, i'm not sure this value to be added by another console. um, so, but the games i i play on the pc. i've only played a few games on the console, um, but i played a lot of games on the pc. is the game that you were talking about multiplayer. like, do you play with a headset multiplayer. so, have you ever played with like random people. 

 yeah, i mean, i played overwatch and i do you talk in the mic and let it like no, okay, they'll be like no, that'd be why i feel like you'd have some good chirps though. yeah, um, i've played the. um, at one point i was quite competitive at quake. um and um played what i think was maybe the first paid esports thing in the us. it was a quake tournament and um, my team came second. we would have come first except the. i was the second best guy on the team and the best guy his. his computer glitched halfway through the game. how hard did you chew out your team after you lost or did you- we've we got money and stuff like this- really check. 

 yeah, although yeah, i mean it wasn't a big check, but it was. so how does the team come together for playing video games like a spacex team. no, it's my first company's up to. 

 oh, no, it's a very early internet company. um, but i play. i play a lot of games. basically, can you imagine if elon goes gta streaming. 

 i mean you'd break the internet in multiple ways, but that'd be the most insane. what are you doing. gta multiplayer: i'm really embarrassed to admit this. i play, uh, okay. yeah, 2k is dope too. 

 i'll play two 2k, 2k 20,, 22, 2k match. don't play fortnite. i know it's really bad, but four nights like the most advanced game- it was the first- like it was huge, it was so big. but i, i, i find chess is like, uh, it's a simple game, frankly, in my opinion. there's. there's a strategy game called polytopia which you can get on your phone, which i think is probably the best strategy game. 

 um, download it now, polytopia. you think chess is simple. yeah, well, i mean, okay, sorry, oh, connect. four is a real. four is simple. two very simple, well, very simple. chess to who, though. 

 no, no, chess just. i mean, you only have 64 squares. there's no fog of war, there's no tech tree. you know, um, but you start adding fog. 

 a wartech tree have like 400 squares. you know a very wide range of units where you can build any unit. you know wide range. 

 it's then the degrees of freedom are just so much greater than channel. so you're raw, as is um, jess, right, well, are you undefeated in chess. is the real question, um, i, i was pretty good at chess as a kid. um, have you been beat. 

 yeah, i sound like i won every game, um, but, uh, you know, i guess, when i, i came to the conclusion that, like, computers are going to get better than humans. oh, yeah, um, by a lot. um, that's why it's important. 

 yeah, i mean, i just i didn't want to spend like a massive amount of effort. just, you know understanding, you know a zillion sort of you know night bishop combinations for sure, two points and game. yeah, of course, um, i'm i'm curious now. yeah, you got a great letter. i am curious now. 

 best of luck. yeah, it's great. paul terpius is great. do you. 

 i need a new addition. do you like. yeah, that's awesome. yeah, i'm just curious. do you gamble at all. like, do you play poker cards. 

 nothing like that. nope, like video games would be like my main sort of thing to do to get away quiet my mind. you know, yeah, i stop the demons in my mind for yelling at me. are you religious at all. i'm not. 

 i'm. i think those are good, the teachings of like. yeah, yeah, yeah, i think good principles, but do you believe in like a god or like a higher power. well, something created: the universe, or the universe is you know here. 

 how did it come to be. um, you could say, whatever caused the universe to come to be is god or you know god's, depending on your view- um, i don't know. and if we can expand consciousness, more humans and more digital intelligence than our opportunity to understand the meaning of life is, is that much greater, deep. 

 and so i would call, like, say, like, i have the philosophy of curiosity, but to understand the nature of reality. so you've never practiced any religions. um, oh, no, i was, uh, you know, i was sent to a- weirdly a hebrew preschool. i'm not jewish, but my dad sent me there because it was like nearby and i guess his partner is in his engineering firm. 

 they sent their kids there. so, um, so i said hebrew preschool, and then, uh, anglican sunday school, and so i was like having a gill one day and jesus ella the next. you know, um and um, you know somebody, but i, i would say that i, you know, was i've never been particularly religious. do you, uh, give an answer for what the meaning of life is, what your meaning in life is. well, i think the the the. currently the thing to do is to expand the, expand humanity and and consciousness to the point where we are able to answer that question. um, i don't think we can answer that question yet, or we can't answer. we can't answer what's meaning of life. well, yet, i find that so interesting. 

 i find that so, and you know what i mean- like could be very. no one on this planet could say: how were we created. that's why i feel like there has to be some sort of higher power. 

 you know, it's gotta be like. we're not smart enough to even explain our own existence. well, we can say, step by step- based on the archaeological evidence, the fossil record and what we know physics- how we came to be at this point. um, so, but that doesn't explain how the universe came to exist in the first place. 

 um, there had to be like something at some point. like we can't even grasp that right. or is this some, well, some higher dimension on which thought and emotion exist. 

 i don't know. um, like, how do molecules have consciousness and feelings. um, so, but you know at least, like the, the, the chain of events from a physics standpoint, from the beginning of the universe to now, are quite well understood, really. yeah, but somehow we're from a bunch of hydrogen gas to, uh, complex molecules, and then an assemblage of complex molecules like ourselves that can feel and talk and and think. so, i mean, just, if you leave hydrogen out long enough, it starts talking to itself. basically, it's what happened here, um, so, so where, along that path, from a bunch of hydrogen molecules to humans, where, where did consciousness start. 

 it's crazy. so, maybe, maybe everything's conscious, um, and we're a pattern of molecules, like the actual atoms in our body change, you know. so, your, the cells in your body. i mean, some cells are stick around for a long time, but most of the cells in your body are regenerated. 

 so, um, like, i think your skin regenerates every seven years or something like that. so, so they're not even the same molecules. they, you know, from one year to the next, the molecules in your body have changed. 

 it's the pattern that stays relatively consistent, the pattern of molecules. so we're a pattern of molecules that can talk and think and feel anyway. this is why i think we should expand- you know we should have more kids and- and grow and expand consciousness and both, and probably have digital consciousness too. what do you mean by expand consciousness. for more people to think, yeah, if more people, more people, more thinking equals more consciousness. you know, like total consciousness is like how many people there are times, average amount of consciousness per question, per person. that's like the total collective consciousness. 

 it's more like a collective group of like. okay, now there's like this many people, so this many brains. yeah, exactly like more. more brains is more. 

 yeah, more consciousness, yeah. does it ever worry you that the younger generations, like start to focus more on social media. right, so they're not going to be as educated on stuff like space, you know things to keep the human civilization going. because it seems like the youth now, like education's not as important as it used to be. 

 i don't know. there's definitely these big generational differences. they can really see it. if you like, watch some, some old movies. like you watch a movie from like the 60s, or movies from the 70s, maybe from the 80s. you can see all these generations a lot. 

 i suppose it would probably be like the original star wars, but that's part of it, is like that's the first movie i ever saw in a theater. oh, really, yeah, wow, i think i saw six years old, something like that. well, so i really made an impression. maybe that's what i like when it all started, right, yeah, maybe that's why i like space. 

 still, it's interesting. it's got to be that. it's probably had an effect. yeah, yeah, i remember it being like super wow at first. i never like said, never been in a movie theater before, and uh, well, it's not that i can remember. and and uh, so imagine seeing like the first movie that you ever saw in a theater, with star wars. 

 that'd be like it's kind of crazy. yeah, six years old. do you remember it like that. yeah, i can remember. i can visualize coming out of the theater. 

 that is insane. i was like i think karate kid. memory is one of the biggest intelligences. that was my first one. all right, did you see the, the, the series, all three. yeah, the series that i made. oh, yeah, uh, i saw the first season, yeah, yeah, the first season of, what. uh, cobra kai. 

 yeah, that's a deep cut. yeah, you're in a couple kai, it was. i watched the first. 

 i think couple, two seasons. um, i mean, it is a twister knife. yeah, it is, it is. i didn't like it. 

 i mean it. no, it was great, the show was safe. but to make you uncomfortable, yeah, yeah, exactly. well, i mean i'm saying you don't like daniel after loving the guy for like 30 years, you know, 30 plus years. yeah, yeah, well, daniel's og. yeah, he loved the guy, yeah, but you got to see it, yeah, yeah, they make you not like them. 

 it's literally the original actors too, yeah, which is also crazy. i've always thought, too, something, uh, with people i've known. i think memory is the biggest piece for intelligence. 

 so if you have a good, really good memory, you're just gonna be smarter than the average. um, like, so, um, like one of the one of the things that i remember was like kind of traumatic. oh my god, it's amazing. yeah, whoa and um. how did rabbi respond to that. not well, yeah, so not well, it's not well. i went to. 

 i went to hebrew school too. i got pulled. you know, yeah, obviously not like. you know, it's just like. oh, you know, it's random costume choice, you know, um and so. 

 so then i'm like i don't know why i'm being punished, um and um. so i was like is that a real thing. that happened, or did i just think that happened. and then my mom actually found a photo of it. really, yeah, how many, how many did they pull you back and say you need to post that picture. and and i just had to sit in the you know principal's office or whatever, uh, for a couple hours- it's a long time if you're a kid- and um, wait for my grandmother come pick me up. wow, i got thrown out of school that day and i was like it's kind of traumatic and i remember that. i remember what that. i remember like what that sort of office looked like where i was just sitting there for a couple hours being confused about why i'm being thrown out of school. how old were you then. 

 i think it must be like four or four, maybe five. dude, how can you remember this stuff. you think if you read, uh, like this, well, that's like, that's what i'm saying. 

 i wasn't sure is this even real. and then, like, and then my mom turns out. she had a picture. how are, like, memories stored in the brain. it's like crazy how we can just like recall like things from i don't know how does, sometimes just butchered. i feel like, yeah, sometimes when you try to recall a memory, you kind of like affect that memory as well. when you're remembering the memory, like, yeah, what's your current state of mind. and like that memory, you could recall that that memory will be like affected by your current state of mind. so you know, sometimes you have to wonder: was that real or not. i mean, um, you know like there's uh like, it's like uh, like an old saying with uh, but i'll please a police saying. 

 like it's like whenever there's a crime, there's like there's always like three stories, like the victim, the perpetrator and the truth. so that could be multiple things, though, right, yeah, i'm just saying, like people's experience of an event, uh, is, um, it's not always accurate. do you think that if you, if you read a page of a book, you could recite the page. i could, i could train to do that. yeah, eventually, like you read one page and you could recite it back just without reading it. 

 yes, there are ways to do this. um, there are memory tricks that can be used to do that. um, so, but i wouldn't say that that's a good use of your brain power. no, so what's the biggest thing you think to teach the brain then. if, if i want to teach my brain something, what's the most valuable thing i could do. 

 you have to say why. sure, just say like y is relevant, and if you can say why something is relevant, you probably will remember it. but because your, your brain, is basically constantly trying to forget everything as much as possible, because it's it's hard, it's hard to store memories. 

 yeah, so it's, it's trying, it's just things you care about. yeah, like, like, most of the stuff that we see in here is like, not worth remembering. um, so, in order for your brain to remember something, you have to establish relevance. 

 the third way would be absurdity. so, if you want to remember an event, um, try, try to imagine that event associated with something completely absurd. it's like for you to remember it. yes, okay, wait, it makes sense, like, so, like, let's say, you want to fix this event in this room, just like. imagine, uh, a, a dancing elephant dressed in a tutu, uh, that's just dancing around the room, and then visualize that and you will remember this. 

 well, what if there's no employees. wow, how do you know that. it's memory trick. that's been. 

 it's a. your brain remembers things that are different. okay, um, and and different can mean like there's a strong emotional association or it's. 

 it's absurd. sure, it's unusual, um, but if, if something is not unusual, if it's, if it's just par for the course, there's nothing, then why, why should your brain bother remembering that. well, does it have to have some sort of importance. i mean to you, i mean like, but like elephants, like i don't give a like, you know what i mean. like, i'm just saying i don't care about the dancing elephant or tutu that's jumping around this room. no, i remember it, but i think what you, you know it's a great way to do it. yeah, yeah, it just anything that's like, that's like you. just your brain's just like trying to save neurons, it's like trying to save brain cells here. so, um, it's just, it's, your brain is really trying to forget as much as possible. so you have to give a reason to not forget and that, and that reason has to be that it is different from a normal day or a normal event, and that. 

 but that difference can be real or you can imagine it. um, so there was a trick that i that i did um for quite a while when i was a kid. i just read a book on memory tricks, basically, and, um, using these, these memory tricks, you can memorize, like, uh, the position of all the cards in a deck. so you could say, uh, have you seen this before. no, no, just wondering why he would flush a toilet paper flush, yeah, i'm flushed at all, didn't want to ruin it. royal flush, don't even piss on the. you know the water. 

 yeah, the reason that i said that those. because, like, if i went through school for high school, college, graduated from college, but everything that you do is a test of your memory. if you're going to go take a test, it's you. how well can you memorize this stuff. well, not every like. 

 if you say, like math stuff. your stepsister. oh, really, yeah, oh, okay, yeah, yeah, she's my age actually. yeah, yeah, works more well. 

 yeah, i spent a lot more time in the library. she was probably out partying but, okay, yeah, she might have sister. but, yeah, yeah, house is yours. um, yeah, she lives in austin. now, she was, she lives in austin. oh, yeah, yeah, no, i know she's married. yeah, yeah, has a kid and everything. oh, wow, this year, often, or uh, not another family events and stuff. 

 nice, she was very sweet the whole time. yeah, elon, how would you describe yourself. i don't know, i don't know, i don't know what you think of yourself. technologists, uh, besides you know, besides what you, i do, technology, yeah, but, like, besides what you've done with you know all you've done. i mean as a person, as like elon musk, as a person, how would you describe yourself. 

 i suppose i would just. i would just say i'm a, a technologist who's curious about the future and generally i'm trying to take the actions that most likely lead to a better future for civilization. i think that's, like, frankly, the only like logical thing to do because, like, if you don't take the, you know there's no point in having, like, a good future without civilization. you know there's no. 

 if civilization crumbles, nobody's going to have a good future. more than anything else, i'm curious, curious about what that just like, like said: the nature of the universe, why do you think. or even what questions to ask. why do you think you made this your goal, though, like when. i guess, when i was kind of growing up, um, i did have this like existential crisis where i was like: what's the meaning of life. is this all pointless. is there any point in existing at all. 

 and i read the various religious texts and, uh, i read a bunch of the philosophers and i just couldn't really seem to find any any good answers. um, here's sort of making that like that's the actual point is: is this: figure out the point. and that was kind of the what answered my existential crisis. 

 i think that's a good. that's a good philosophy, basically, um, now, it's a philosophy that may, i think, maybe for a lot of people, may be uncomfortable, because it's like it's a jeep too. i i think it is a a rational and logical philosophy, um, but it is one that that does not get that. that's basically saying, hey, we don't know what the answer is, but let's try to find out for sure. do you feel like you know part of the answer. 

 yeah, i think you know, we as humans collectively- no part of the answer, um, but only a small, small part at this point. it was like 5 000 years ago, just practically no time at all. um, so if we were to last a million more years, then, like, we're barely at the beginning of civilization, yeah, that's true. 

 like, if civilization does last many years, we will be seen, they'll think of us as like ancient, ancients, like it would be like cavemen and everything you know pretty much. yeah, yeah, how probable, how probable do you think that is. that would last another million years. i think it's probable. if we don't, if we never expand beyond earth, then i don't think the civil, uh, that this life span of of humanity will be long. 

 what do you think it would be. do you think earth's coming to an end. oh, that is a certainty. 

 it's just a question of when. oh my goodness, how. so like natural, naturally, or there's a lot of man-made. i like believe everything this guy says. 

 there's a lot of factors. he's right, he knows what you're doing, you know. well, i mean this. the sun is gradually expanding and, and the sun so, if nothing else happens, the sun will expand and boil the oceans and kill all life on earth. that is a certainty. that's a certainty. 

 that's certainty. well, how far. how far are we out from wait. because the sun's expanding, like it's growing. yeah, it's expanding because it's very slowly, not incrementally, don't hold your breath on this one. but, um, you know, things could get a bit dicey in 500 million years, um, like you know. so when are they predicting that this, that like that growth, would become like an actual threat, though. 

 well, it's not going to be in our lifetimes or anything close to it. but i'm just saying that, uh, if you, if you look, think very long term, then then the extinction of earth is a certainty. so, uh, now there's pro like, like, if you look at the fossil record, it's worth looking at, like the great extinction events. 

 just read it. you just would like read the wikipedia page or something you know, or read encyclopedia britannica, like the like the great extinction events in the fossil record. basically, no large life was survived, or almost no large life. so permanent extinction took out almost everything. what were those extinction events. what was like the craziest one. well, like the, the most amount of species death was the permian extinction. um, i recommend just looking at reading the great you know from what. 

 what have we found in the fossil record about great extinctions. wow, yeah, um, now we'll see that one coming, you know, most likely, um, but he also has a gigantic volcano. never knew that. 

 yeah, i didn't know that. yeah, have you been there. i've never been to yellowstone seen. last time a volcano erupted, well, they were up to. you know, there's like little eruptions quite frequently. central america is like a huge one. 

 there's a big one in guatemala, i think. there's a plenty of those that'll take out a continent. um, earth's climate also changes pretty radically over the course of like say, 10 000 years. um, you know, it can shift from being extremely hot to extremely cold and turn across. now, yeah, you can really go down a deep rabbit hole if you read about ice ages. yeah, really like the deep route hole on ice ages. 

 what's so intriguing about them. the whole earth that's just been through, like the whole earth is just freezing. like i said, this deep rabbit hole on ice ages, the private hole. 

 where should we get so many. i guess. wait, there's something wrong with this tidbit of it. yeah, why do you love it. 

 what i love it. so, um, you know, anyway, there's, there's also been times where in the past, where our galaxy is like collided with another galaxy. um, that probably, should you know, threw things for a bit of a loop at the time. why is there like a conspiracy when it comes to ice ages or anything like that, or is it not really. no, okay, when was the last ice age. 

 how long ago was that. well, we're technically in sort of an ice age right now, although it depends on what you call an ice age. what happened to global warming. wait, but yeah, how. so, like, what defines an ice age. 

 at that point, global warming is like cool anymore. it's a deep rabbit hole. um, what do you do when you're going down a deep rabbit hole, though. is it youtube, videos, books, or how do you educate yourself on wikipedia, the internet. and, yeah, books and clicking around the internet, googling wikipedia. you know, youtube, whatever, um, so twitter, um can be interesting, um, so the. so, yeah, um, like i said, there have been times when earth has been extremely tropical and where it's been a snowball, but these these tend to occur over very long periods of time. um, i don't think it's like the end of the world or anything, but it's gonna. 

 it's gonna cause drive. so that's why it's good to accelerate a sustainable energy future for sure. i know this is kind of off topic, but i do want to ask, completely off topic: how expensive is it to send one human to mars. if you want to break it down by human, well, right now, it's infinity dollars. yeah, infinity bitcoin and dollars and everything, meaning like no amount of money. 

 could. you could say you could not send someone to mars for any amount of money right now. now with starship, you know, hopefully, when starship is successful, sasha will be capable of sending people to mars. 

 i think, long term, we could get the cost of a trip to mars maybe under a hundred thousand dollars. wow, what. wow, yeah, it's like. let me just say that it's not physically impossible to achieve that per person. or, yeah, oh, is this a hundred thousand. but that's not that crazy. to go to different planets, no, that's not bad. yeah, why, how do you. 

 how do you say, like, what's the. if you have a fully reusable vehicle and you, your propellant costs are low, then then it is possible to achieve a cost per person number below 100 000.. and how many people can you fit on the space shuttle order. 

 well, space shuttle is not capable of going, sorry, beyond earth, but, um, rocket, right, the current version of starship, you could, you could put 100 people on it. um, so then you know you'd have to get the cost of the flight. how do you break that cost below 10 million. 

 how do you kill the cost. i feel like it's got to be way more expensive than that. it's like first class on emirates, it's really. no, it's like 40k, okay, but 100k, like that's. uh, you haven't flown first class when emirates, have you. 

 no, never. but i'm saying like 100k is like a private jet from new york to europe. right, well, we're talking about taking a rocket to mars. 

 so how, how, how are those costs even similar. um, you say, like i'm saying in the, in the limit of of affordability, is it possible to achieve a cost of a trip to mars below 100 000 per person. i'm like, yes, it is. it is not impossible. um. 

 so. is that unfair, though, because you got to assume rich people we're going to be the guy or the- not the guys, but the people- that can afford that. um, somehow it's like gotta pay for the rocket, you know, yeah, i need a lot of rockets, so, but i'm confident that it is possible to create a self-sustaining city on mars. yeah, um, similar to the earth, eventually, in terms of restaurants, clubs, yeah, all that. maybe maybe you start with like the, the coolest hotel, club and restaurant ever. 

 then you entice people to go there. nice golf courses too- yeah, you got that involved. yeah, i mean, the golf ball would go much further on on mars. yeah, no, it's only. it's only like, uh, like 37,, 38 of us gravitational, so you'd be able to like kind of jump more than twice as high. yeah, you probably about hit that ball like 500 yards. 

 yeah, there, you don't go far. do you think like exclusivity would make people want to go to mars. even it's going to be exclusive, no matter what, bro, there's enough people that if there's only a hundred people, but it's gonna be a huge one. but what i mean by like, but you have to in order for it to be self-sustaining, you've got to have like a million people. so a million, i think. so i mean to have for self-sustaining build like where you don't need any comments, like if the ships from earth stop coming for any reason. does that. 

 does the city die out. right, that's a hard, that's a hard. that's a high bar, you know. 

 that's why you can't be missing anything. oh, wow, i don't know. million, that's crazy. so i think it's probably at least a million. 

 do you got half. no, no, um, but people can live there. that's before when you don't need resources from the earth, right, yeah. yeah, i'm saying in order to make it self-sustaining, but in order for, in order to ensure humanity's future for a long time, it's got, you've got to have a self-sustaining city. 

 if it's dependent on earth, then you're still like, okay, if something bad happens to earth and mars is going to die out, too sure, so to make it self-sustaining is where that's. that's the real threshold. that matters how long. when it's like, when it's all said and done, like how long would a trip take. well, right now a trip would take six months, but i think you get the trip under three months. 

 six months, yeah, yeah, i thought it was years. oh no, now earthenware is only a line every two years. so earthenwars are only like the same, called the same quadrant of the solar system every two years. so you have to do that. 

 you line up every two years, but then it's like a six month journey, so that's the only time you could go when they're lying. yeah, because sometimes mars is on the other side of the sun. you know, unless you're gonna go through the sun, so it's not gonna happen. yeah, so if. 

 yeah, so they need to be in same quadrant, taking into account the how the planets move relative to one another. wow, um, so, so you only have a short one. come back. this earth is zipping around the, you know, zips around the sun every year. a mars is about every two years. you gotta wait two years to come back, but it is crazy. 

 you gotta spend right now. you said six months on a rocket with a hundred other people. right, what does that look like. also crazy, cramped. yeah, you think people lose their hands. yeah, what it. 

 what do they do. they definitely were. they were sailing journeys that were more than six months in old times on really tiny ships. six months on a rocket. you'd have to. yeah, that'd be like a mental. 

 that's a mental thing you really got to overcome six months ago was well, being in a rocket feature like martin's. yeah, you gotta bring some chicks up in there too, i mean, if i go upstairs. you said 100 people, so if we go with 99 chicks, then you're good. you need, you need at least more than half, yeah, and then i'll be in there for six years, sure. ah, that's why you got starlink, right, wait, do the rockets have wi-fi. uh, yeah, although you're, because the speed of light actually becomes an issue, um, if you start getting far away from earth. um, so, in rough terms, at closest approach, mars is four light minutes away from earth, okay, and furthest approach maybe it's like 20 minutes, roughly. um, so that means there could be times where, like, a round trip to communicate with mars takes 40 minutes. best case is gonna be eight minutes ish. 

 that's not crazy. how do you make sure people are repopulating. you mean of earth or mars, mars, i don't know. um, hopefully they do have a lot of kids. sex, yeah, yeah, hopefully they have a lot of kids on mars. yeah, what would the laws be like. i know it's like a whole new place: banned condoms. 

 what about the currency too. you should make 69 laws, yeah, exactly, oh, my, imagine elon making the laws. that would be awesome. 

 he's working on it. if you're the first one there, you get that. there's so many, you get that authority right, i don't know. like i said, that window of opportunity it could be open for a long time, could be open for a short time, but we should assume that is open for a short time. so just, you know, to be safe, i think we should assume the window opportunity is short and you know, at some point there's going to be a third world war. you know, yeah, of course. uh, yeah, you know. and after world war three, uh, you know who knows what's left after world war three. 

 um, i think that's what nuclear warfare it could. um, so there's arguably this: like you know, the cycle is this race between do we become a multi-planet species or world war three, which one is first. and if world war three is first and maybe we never get to another planet, you know, yeah, salim's not sleeping tonight. a lot of the information man you're saying that. yeah, i'm probably not gonna sleep. yeah, it's already interesting with a lot of things that you've been saying. it's really, really interesting. it seems like it's scary, but like it seems like world war iii, nuclear war, could happen anytime. 

 yeah, you gotta live in reality, right under that assumption. do we have a secret rocket that's ready to go to send people to mars, just in case. nope, no, no, yeah, just gotta get a boxable in the middle of nowhere, right. i mean spacex. we're trying to hustle with the rocket and get it get, get working. 

 but we, you know we're going to make it. we got to get to orbit in the first place and then we got to make it reusable, like, so that's really important. um, if rockets are expandable, then the cost is crazy. yeah, um, so you got to have to be reusable, like an airplane, like you know. 

 it comes back, you re re-fuel it and go again, type of thing. how much of the rocket can you reuse. well, starship, the whole thing, is designed to be reused. 

 really, holy, that's crazy. if sasha will really be quite a big breakthrough. if it's the first fully reusable rocket, orbital rocket, i mean that's a profound breakthrough. the destiny of humanity will fundamentally change, uh, at the point of which starship demonstrates full and rapid reusability. correct me if i'm wrong, but spacex is the first that made the reusable rocket right, like nasa, no one ever fully usable- yeah, fully reusable. 

 yes, they thought it wouldn't be expensive, but it turned out to be very expensive. um, so the shuttle, also the parts of the shuttle that were reusable were very difficult to reuse. so, um, like the orbiter, the aircraft looking thing, um, that took a lot of effort to refurbish between flights, and the solar rocket booster shells. 

 it's not clear that those error made sense to reuse. um, so the thing that matters is is full and rapid reusability, um, but like, basically, where you don't do anything between flights except refill the tanks. um, so the, the falcon 9 boosters, we've reflown those a lot. 

 at this point. we've landed them a lot like over a hundred times of, and, and individual boosters have flown, i think, 13 times this point. and the nose cone or the fairing. 

 we've gotten the fairing back now over 100 times. so we've achieved reusability of everything except the upper stage with falcon 9 and we've demonstrated economically viable reusability. so that's the most significant thing that spacex has done. now the starlink global internet system will also be very significant, um, and that is intended to generate enough revenue to pay for the marshes. 

 so if, with assuming, starlink is successful, it should generate enough revenue to pay for enough ships to get humanity to mars and the moon as well. um, yeah, a lot of knowledge. man, it's crazy. yeah, so that's the intent. um, really like we had a long way to go. 

 so it's not like, so likes in the bag or anything. so either we get to mars or, if putin gets out of hand, we send elon in to walrusom. yeah, we got the dana white connect. we can make it happen. yeah, the walrus, i think that's probably our best, our best channel. yeah, i think we're good. elon, we really appreciate this. i mean, you're so much the best, it's been a blast. yeah, yeah, we really appreciate it. 

 yeah, it's good hanging out. you want to go. thank you, thank you, really appreciate it. thank you so much. thank you. 

 great conversation, great, yeah, great question. that was like three hours. that was crazy. 

 watch him come compete with the new zelter. all right, everyone. thank you for watching that pod. i seriously can't believe we got elon on the pod. honestly, shout out to all our metacard holders: uh, if you guys don't know- if you guys are new here- we dropped our metacard, which is our nft project, earlier this year. we basically have the best community out of any project. we're in the discord all the time. 

 i'm in there a few times a week. we're always dropping exclusive info about nell, what we're working on, our business videos, just anything new. the best way to kind of interact with us is to join the meta card project and get in the discord, and it's only available to holders. so if you guys want to join and be in that exclusive community, grab a metacard. they're still available on openc. we'll put the link in the description. so go to openc, grab a metacard, join the best community, the exclusive community, and we have a ton, a ton, a ton of big stuff we're working on this year. 

 um discord. we love you boys and thank you seriously everyone. elon musk on the podcast: life is crazy. 

 it's only going to get crazier. we love you boys.. . .
