"danny rick has been struggling this year on pace consistency and overall results, and it's not helped by his teammate, lando, outperforming that card this season. at the moment, lando has 48 points to daniel's 11, so lando has brought in 82 percent of mclaren's points so far this season. then there is qualifying pace. on average, lando is six tenths of a second quicker in the same car. so i looked into what's going on here, but to understand that, we need to understand ricardo's driving style, because it will explain why he was so quick at red bull but not so much at mclaren. quickly, though, i need to mention that dany has had some great results, with several podiums and even a win back in monza, but ultimately what we're looking at is one of the drivers with the worst records compared to their teammate, who is obviously working with the same tools. so really it's the gap to lando that's interesting here. so what is daniel ricardo's driving style like? well, i've broken down a number of driving styles on this channel, and really they are subtle points that allow the driver to get the car through the corner more quickly. for example, hamilton is incredible on the brakes. he's able to get the car stopped well without losing time on exit. that all usually takes a more veed offline to rotate the car mid-corner, similar to michael schumacher. but all of these driving styles tie in closely with the car they are driving. for example, alonso back in 2005 and 2006 was driving a renault with a really strong rear end and using tyres that were rock hard, so he induced understeer all the way into the corner, which heated the tyres and gave him the grip to pivot the car mid corner and fire it out on the exit. but he isn't using that style this year, for example, as it would chew up the tyres and he would be pretty slow. but having said that, dany was at his peak at red bull between 2014 and 2018, so let's have a look at his style from back then. the red ball was incredible aerodynamically, with more raw downforce than the other teams on the whole, but the renault engine wasn't great, so they were comparatively quick in the corners but slower on the straights. but what made danny great in that car was that it fit his style really well. now we know him as last of the late breakers, but really that's only when overtaking. when daniel was on a normal lap, he would actually break a little bit earlier than most of the drivers. and that helped because you can keep the car more level, allowing dany to turn in pretty aggressively and carry a high minimum speed through the corner. so a smoother braking phase kept the car flatter, which, with the right car, allows you to keep the aerodynamics working well throughout the corner. so danny would set the car to be very stable on entry. he doesn't want the car moving around on the way into the corner. speaking to blake from break f1, who was a performance engineer at red bull for that time, max didn't mind the car moving on entry, whereas daniel didn't really like it. and this style also relies on having a car with great front end grip. because daniel isn't hard on the brakes through the corner, you have less weight on those front tires and less load pushing them into the ground, so the car can lean into understeer, which means you run wide and sacrifice the exit. and you can see this style in the data. this is the fastest qualifying lap at monaco in 2018 between daniel, who got pole, and hamilton. you can see that the merc is much, much quicker on the straights, but the minimum speed through the tight corners was where daniel gained the time. so this is why daniel got seven of his eight wins at red bull and was pretty much always on the pace with his teammate throughout that time. then daniel went to renault, where it wasn't plain sailing. the car wasn't quick but did have a similar overall setup to the red bull. daniel has said in interviews that the car didn't have the grip of the red bull, but he could drive it in a similar way. then, skipping forward to when daniel joined mclaren, and whilst he has driven two very different cars- the 2021 car and the 2022 car- daniel has had similar issues with both. going to mclaren last year it seemed almost as though ricardo couldn't get the car turned, couldn't get it rotated past the apex and the way that he wanted to. he was actually running out of road on on the corner exit. so that would then lead us to think. you know that the 21 mclaren, in contrast to earlier red bulls, didn't rotate as well on the corners, which suggests that maybe it's a slightly weaker front axle, a more stable rear axle, in contrast to the rebels which typically have a more loose rear axle. so it seems that the mclaren has a really strong rear end, is good on the brakes, but can understeer a little bit and, according to various interviews over the last two years, this has caused an issue for daniel and it seems that the understeer issue is the main one. as i mentioned earlier, the red ball has a lot of front end grip, enabling daniel to roll the car into the corner with a lot of speed without a lot of brake pressure. this then allows more weight over the rear of the car for a better exit. but, as scarbs mentioned, you can run out of road on the exit so that all kind of adds up and some drivers were able to, you know, adapt to this and get it to work. and there was clearly circuits and days where it worked for for daniel. but on the whole, it seems is that the way that that front axle work doesn't doesn't really work for for daniel and the way he likes to rotate the car, particularly when he's doing these kind of classic overtaking moves where he just kind of straight lines to the apex and get it rotated at the apex while already in front of his rival, and that is a good point. overtakes are a different style altogether. you're not optimizing for the highest minimum corner speed through a corner or the best run out of it. you're trying to get ahead of your opponent and block the ideal line which allows you to get ahead. so the style is different there. but what is lando doing differently? well, he seems much happier with the card that is less stable on the brakes and with a little more understeer. one way to drive a car with a hint of understeer is to break late and deep into the corner. this puts a lot of load on the front tires all the way into the apex, but removes grip from the rear. this lower rear grip then allows you to pivot the car on the front axle through the corner, which then allows you to get a good exit. in general, cars with a hint of understeer are normally much more stable on the power, so you can gain time on the exit. and i looked back at a load of lando's on boards from the last two years and in general he does seem to set his car up with a hint of understeer, which allows him to jump on the throttle on the way out of the corner. and that, to me, seems to be the difference here. lando is natural in that car, it suits him and he's happier with the car moving around. but daniel doesn't have the confidence in it at the moment, and you can see this in qualifying at monaco. daniel is much less confident on the brakes, and you can see it here on the way into the key breaking zones. daniel is lifting where lando isn't. now there is likely some track progression here, but not nearly a second's worth. so daniel really isn't confident in that car. but you could argue that monaco is pretty atypical. so let's take a look at the most typical f1 track, barcelona. here the gap is closer, but still three tenths of a second. lando is gaining the time in the slow speed corners, particularly those with a sharp change of direction. this again points at this issue of the car moving around on the brakes, and daniel isn't handling this as well as lando. now, of course, daniel has been working on changing his driving style, being more aggressive on the brakes and rotating the car more mid-corner, but that's a tricky thing to do. so let's see if he does indeed manage to change it this season. you should check out this video on why cena's driving style wouldn't work in today's cars. thanks for watching and i'll catch you in the next one."
