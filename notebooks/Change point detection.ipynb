What we were pitching was a private cloud system\n","621: Everybody knows about cloud computing now\n","622: It's like why your gmail account is available wherever you go\n","623: It's why facebook has this massive system of records for everyone everywhere\n","624: The government wanted to have these kind of capabilities\n","625: To dell ended up getting beat out by amazon\n","626: Some people aren't familiar with this\n","627: Many of them are, but amazon runs a secret cloud system for the government\n","628: I forget what they've rebranded it now, but there's this massive connection between industry and government in the classified space that just goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper\n","629: But at this point, I had misgivings because of what I'd seen in japan about government\n","630: But I was just trying to get by\n","631: I was trying to ignore the conflicts\n","632: I was trying to ignore the inconsistencies\n","633: And I think this is a state that a lot of people in these large institutions, not just in our country, but around the world, struggle with every day\n","634: They got a job, they got a family, they got bills\n","635: They're just trying to get by\n","636: And they know that some of the things they're doing are not good things\n","637: They know some of the things they're doing are actively wrong, but they know what happens to people who rock the boat\n","638: Eventually I changed my mind\n","639: And when I had gone to hawaii, which was the final position in my career with the intelligence community, because of an accident of history here, I wasn't supposed to be in this position at all\n","640: I was supposed to be at a group called the national threat operations center EndoC\n","641: But because of the way contracting works, and again, this is covered in the book, I end up being reassigned to this little rinky dink office that nobody's ever heard of in hawaii called the office of information sharing\n","642: And I'm replacing this old timer who's about to retire\n","643: Really nice guy, but he spent most of his days just reading novels and doing nothing and letting people be content to the fact or letting people forget that his office existed because he was the only one in it\n","644: There's a manager who's, like, over him, but it's actually over a larger group, and he just looks over him as sort of a favor\n","645: So now I come in, and now I'm the sole employee of the office of information sharing, but I'm not close enough to retirement that I'm okay with just doing nothing at all\n","646: So I get ambitious, and I come up with this idea for a new system called the heartbeat\n","647: And what the heartbeat is going to do is connect to basically every information repository in the intelligence community, both at the NSA and across network boundaries, which you normally can't cross\n","648: But because I've worked at both the CIA and the NSA, I knew the network well enough, both sides, that normal workers at the NSA would never have seen because you have to be in one or the other\n","649: I could actually connect these together\n","650: I could build bridges across this kind of network space and then draw all of these records into a new kind of system that was supposed to look at your digital ID, basically your sort of ID card that says, this is who I am\n","651: I work for this agency\n","652: I work in this office\n","653: These are my assignments, these are my group affiliations\n","654: And because of that, the system would be able to eventually aggregate records that were relevant to your job, that were related to you, and then it could provide them\n","655: And basically you could hit this site\n","656: It would be an update of what we used to call reboards, which were manually created\n","657: Then we go, look, you work in network defense, right? These are all the things that are happening on network defense\n","658: You work on, I don't know, economic takeovers in Guatemala\n","659: What's going on for you there? But in my off time, I helped the team that sat next to me, which was a systems administration team for Windows networks because I had been a Microsoft certified systems engineer, which means basically I knew how to take care of Windows networks\n","660: And this was all those guys did, and they always had way too much work, way too much work\n","661: And I had basically no work that I needed to do at all because all I was supposed to do was share information, which was not something that was particularly in demand because most people already knew what they wanted or what they needed\n","662: So it was basically my job was to sit there and collect a paycheck unless I wanted to get ambitious\n","663: I did some side gigs for these other guys, and one of them was running what we're called dirty word searches\n","664: Now, dirty word searches are let me dial this back because I know where this is hard to track\n","665: Everything that the NSA does in large part is classified\n","666: Everything the CIA does in large part is classified\n","667: If I made lunch plans with other people in my office, it was classified\n","668: That was the policy\n","669: It's dumb\n","670: This overclassification problem is one of the central flaws in government right now\n","671: This is the reason we don't understand what they're doing\n","672: This is why they can get away with breaking the law or violating our rights for so long, five years, ten years, 1550 years before we see what they were doing\n","673: And it's because of this routine classification, right? But every computer system has a limit on what level of classified information is supposed to be stored on it\n","674: And we've got all these complicated systems for code words and caveats that establish a system of what's called compartmentation\n","675: And this is the idea when you work at the CIA, when you work at the NSA, you're not supposed to know what's happening in the office next to you, right? Because you don't have need to know\n","676: Right? Again, that thing from the movies\n","677: And the reason they have this is they don't want one person to be able to go and know everything and tell everybody everything\n","678: They don't want anybody to know too much, particularly when they're doing lots of bad things, because then there's the risk that you realize they're doing so many bad things that it's past the point that we can justify, and they might develop sort of an ideological objection to that\n","679: Well, in the office of information sharing and actually, in basically every part of my career before that, I had access to everything\n","680: I had what was called a special caveat on my accesses called privacy, which means privileged access\n","681: What this means is you're kind of super user\n","682: Most people have all of these controls on the kind of information they can access, but I'm in charge of the system\n","683: People who need information, they have to get it from somewhere they don't know\n","684: Even the director of the CIA, right, he says, I need to know everything about this\n","685: He doesn't know where to get it\n","686: He's just a manager\n","687: Somebody has to be able to actually cross these thresholds and get those things\n","688: That guy was me\n","689: And so dirty word searches were these kind of automated queries that I would set up to go across the whole network and look at all of the different levels of classification and compartmentation and exceptionally controlled information\n","690: You can think of it as above top secret in these special compartments, right, where you're not even supposed to know what these compartments are for\n","691: You only know the code word unless you work in them, unless you have access to them, unless you read into them\n","692: Well, one day I got a hit on the dirty word search for a program that I'd never heard of called Stellar Wind\n","693: It came back because the little caveat for it, they're called handling Caveats, which is like, you can think of, like, burn after reading or For Your Eyes only\n","694: But this one's called Stlw, which means Stellar Wind\n","695: Unless you know what Stellar Wind is, you don't know how to handle it\n","696: All I knew was it wasn't supposed to be on my system\n","697: This is a little bit unusual\n","698: And it turned out this document was placed on the system because one of the employees who had worked on this program years before had come to Hawaii\n","699: And this person was a lawyer\n","700: I believe\n","701: And they had worked in the Inspector General's office\n","702: And they had compiled a report\n","703: Part of the Inspector General's report\n","704: Which is when the government is investigating itself into the operations and activities of this program\n","705: Well, this was the domestic mass surveillance program that I talked about in the very beginning of our conversation that started under the Bush White House\n","706: Stellar Wind was no longer supposed to be really an operation it had been unveiled in a big scandal in December 2005 in The New York Times by a journalist, James Rising\n","707: And I'm not going to name them because I don't want to get it wrong another journalist\n","708: You can look at the byline if you want to see their involvement, and there's a lot of history here, too\n","709: But what they had found was, of course, the Bush White House had constructed a warrantless wiretapping program, if you remember, the warrantless wiretapping scandal that was affecting everyone in the United States\n","710: Well, the Bush White House was really put in a difficult position by this scandal\n","711: They would have lost the election over this scandal because The New York Times actually had this story in October 2004, which was the election year\n","712: They were ready to go with it, but at the specific request of the White House, talking to the publisher of The New York Times, Salzburger, and Bill Keller, then the executive editor of The New York Times, the New York Times said we won't run the story because the president just said, if you run this story a month before the election, that's a very tight margin\n","713: If you recall, you'll have blood on your hands\n","714: And it was so close to 2001\n","715: The New York Times just went, you know what? Fine\n","716: Americans don't need to know that the Constitution is being violated\n","717: They don't need to know that the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean what they think it means\n","718: If the government says it's all right and it's a secret and you shouldn't know about it, that's fine\n","719: Now, December 2005, why did that change? Why did the New York Times suddenly run this story? Well, it's because James Rison, the reporter who found this story, had written a book, and he was about to publish this book\n","720: And The New York Times was about to be in a very uncomfortable position of having to explain why they didn't run this story and how they got scooped by their own journalists\n","721: And so they finally did it, but it was too late\n","722: Bush had been reelected, and now it was sweeping up the broken glass of our lost rights\n","723: So Congress, the Bush White House, was very effective and as I said before, telling a very few select members of Congress that this program existed, and they told them this program existed in ways that they wouldn't object to, but made them culpable for hiding the existence from the program, the existence of the program from the American people\n","724: And this is why someone like Nancy Pelosi, who you wouldn't exactly think would be buddy buddy with George Bush, was completely okay in defending this kind of program\n","725: In fact, later she said, oh, well, she had objections to the program that she wrote in a letter to the White House, but she never showed us the letter\n","726: She went, oh, well, that was classified, right\n","727: And this is not to bag on her individually\n","728: It's just she's a great example in here and not named example\n","729: Everyone knows of how this process works\n","730: The White House will implicate certain very powerful members of Congress in their own criminal activity\n","731: And so then when the White House gets in trouble for it, the Congress has to run cover for the White House\n","732: And so what happened was Congress passed an emergency law in 2007 called the Protect America Act, which should have been our first indication this is a very bad thing because they never name a law something like that unless something terrible\n","733: And what it did was it retroactively immunized all of the phone companies in the United States that had been breaking the law millions of times a day by handing your records over to the government\n","734: Which they weren't allowed to do simply on the basis of a letter from the President saying\n","735: Please do this\n","736: And these companies went\n","737: Look\n","738: Now that we've been uncovered\n","739: Now that we've been shown that we're breaking or now that these journalists have shown that we've broken the law and violated the rights of Americans on a staggering scale that could bankrupt our companies because we can be sued for this\n","740: We will no longer cooperate with you unless you pass a law that says people can't sue us for having done this\n","741: And so we get the Protect America Act, which is an emergency\n","742: This is all public history too\n","743: Yeah, you can look this up on Wikipedia\n","744: And so then they go, it's an emergency law\n","745: We have to pass this now\n","746: We have to keep this program active\n","747: Bush is going to end the warrantless wiretapping program and continue it under this new authority where it's going to have some special level of oversight and these kind of things eventually\n","748: But for now, we just have to make sure people are safe again\n","749: They go to fear\n","750: They say, if we don't have this program, terrorist attacks will continue\n","751: People will die\n","\n","752: Blood on your hands\n","753: Blood on your hands\n","754: Blood on your hands\n","\n","755: Think of the Children protect America act passes\n","756: The companies get off the hook\n","757: The bush white House gets off the hook\n","758: The Congress that was then sharing in criminal culpability for authorizing or rather letting these things go by without stopping them, then passes in 2008 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments of 2008\n","759: This is called the FAA FISA Menu Act of 2008\n","760: And rather than stopping all of the unlawful and sort of unconstitutional activities that the intelligence agency was doing, they continued it in different ways simply by creating a few legal hoops for them to jump through\n","761: Now, this is not to say these things aren't helpful at all\n","762: It's not to say they're not useful at all\n","763: But it's important to understand when the government's response to any scandal, and this applies to any country, is not two of the person who is caught breaking the law comply with the law but instead make the activities of the person who is breaking the law legal\n","764: Right\n","765: They make the law comply with what the agencies want to do rather than make the agencies comply with the law\n","766: That's a problem\n","767: And that's what happened here\n","768: Now, the intelligence community's powers actually grew in response to this scandal in 2008 because Congress was on the hook and they just wanted to move on and get this over with\n","769: There were objections\n","770: There were people who knew this was a bad idea, but it didn't pass on\n","771: Now, what the public took away from this because a part of these laws was a requirement, that the Inspector general of all of these different intelligence community elements and the Director of National Intelligence submit a report saying, this is what happened under that warrantless wiretapping program\n","772: This is how it complied with the law or how it didn't comply with the law\n","773: And basically look back at how this program was constituted, what it did, what the impacts and effects were\n","774: And that was supposed to be sort of the Truth and Reconciliation Council right? Now, why am I talking about all this ancient history? Well, I'm sitting here in 2012 with a classified Inspector General's draft report from the NSA\n","775: The names\n","776: Names? That says Dick Cheney\n","777: This says David Addington\n","778: This is Nancy Pelosi\n","779: This is all these people who are involved in the program, the ticktok of how it happens\n","780: It says the director of the NSA, the guy who was evacuating the building at the beginning of our podcast here, that guy was asked by the President of the United States if he would continue this program after being told by the White House and the Department of justice that these programs were not lawful, that they were not constitutional\n","781: And the President said, would you continue this program on my say so alone, knowing that it's risky, knowing that it's unlawful? And he said, yes, sir, I will if you think that's what's necessary to keep the country safe\n","782: And at that moment, I realized these guys don't care about the law\n","783: These guys don't care about the Constitution\n","784: These guys don't care about the American people\n","785: They care about the continuity of government\n","786: They care about the state\n","787: Right? And this is something that people have lost\n","788: We hear this phrase over and over again, national security\n","789: National security, national security\n","790: And we're meant to interpret that to mean public safety\n","791: But national security is a very different thing from public safety\n","792: National security is a thing that in previous generations we refer to as state security\n","793: National security was a kind of term that came out of the Bush administration to run cover for the fact that we were elevating a new kind of secret police across the country\n","794: And what does it mean, again, in a democracy in the United States, the public is not partner to government\n","795: The public does not hold the leash of government anymore\n","796: But we are subject to government, right? We are subordinate to government, and we're not even allowed to know that it happened\n","797: Now, in the book, I tell the fact that I had access to the unclassified version of this report back in Japan\n","798: And what's interesting is the unclassified version of the report, and we've all seen this today with things like the Mueller report and all of the intelligence reporting that's happened over the last several years\n","799: When the government provides a classified report to the public, it's normally the same document, the unclassified version, the classified version of the same thing\n","800: It's just the Unclassified version has things blacked out or redacted that they say, oh, you're not allowed to know this sentence or this paragraph or this page or whatever\n","801: The document that the public had been given about the warrantless wiretapping program was a completely different document\n","802: It was a document tailor made to deceive and mislead the Congress and the public of the United States\n","803: And it was effective in doing that\n","804: And in 2012, what I realized was this is what real world conspiracies look like, right? It doesn't have to be smoking men behind closed doors\n","805: It's lawyers and politicians\n","806: It's ordinary people from the working level to the management level who go, if we don't explain this in a certain way, we're all going to lose our jobs or the other way they go, we're going to get something out of this if we all work together\n","807: Civilization is the history of conspiracy, right? What is civilization but a conspiracy for all of us to do better by working together? But it's this kind of thing that I think too often we forget because it's boring as hell\n","808: I want all your listeners, right, to go to the Washington Post because this document that I discovered that really changed me has been published courtesy of the Washington Post\n","809: It's called the Inspector General's Report on Stellar Wind\n","810: And you can look at the actual document that I saw that was unredacted, right? I had no blacked out pages on mine\n","811: And what I believe it shows is that some of the most senior officials in the United States, elected and unelected, worked together to actively undermine the rights of the American people to give themselves expanded powers\n","812: Now, in their defense, they said they were seeking these powers for a good and just and noble cause\n","813: They say they were trying to keep us safe\n","814: But that's what they always say\n","815: That's what every government says\n","816: That's no different than what the Chinese government says or the Russian government says\n","817: And the question is, if they are truly keeping us safe, why wouldn't they simply just tell us that? Why wouldn't they have that debate in Congress? Why wouldn't they put that to a vote? Because if they were, and they could convince us that they were, they'd win the vote\n","818: And particularly we all know, like the Patriot act passed\n","819: One of the worst pieces of legislation in modern history passed\n","820: Why didn't we get a vote? And I think if you read the report, the answer will be clear\n","821: So I'm sorry, Joe, I went on for very long\n","822: No, it was amazing\n","823: Don't apologize at all\n","824: It's just completely fascinating that the continuation of this policy came down to one man and the president having this discussion that is much more but literally the president at the heart of it\n","825: Yes, at the heart of it in every expression of executive power, right? And by executive, we mean the white house here, the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, the DOJ, right? These guys exist as a part of the executive branch of government in a real way\n","826: They work for the white house\n","827: Now, there are laws and regulations and policies that are supposed to say they're supposed to do this and they're supposed to say they're not supposed to do that\n","828: But when you look at federal regulations, when you look at policies as an employee of government, when you violate these policies, the worst thing that happens to you is you lose your job because there's no criminal penalty for the violation of these laws\n","829: And so it's very easy for people who exist in these structures, particularly at the very top levels of these structures, to go, look, we have a given set of lawful authorities, and these are defined very broadly to give us leeway, to do whatever it is we think is proper and appropriate and just\n","830: Now take that proper and appropriate just from the perspective of any given individual, right, any given president\n","831: Now intersect that with what's good for them politically, and that's where problems begin to arise\n","832: Now, the safety measure that's supposed to protect us from this in the US\n","833: System and democracy broadly is these people are supposed to be what are called public officials\n","834: That means we know their decisions\n","835: That means we know their policies\n","836: That means we know their programs and prerogatives and powers like what they are doing both in our name and what they're doing against us\n","837: And because they are transparent to us, we the people, can then police their activities\n","838: We can go, I disagree with this\n","839: We can protest it, we can campaign against it, right? We can try to become the president, do whatever\n","840: They are public officials, and we are private citizens\n","841: They're not supposed to know anything about us, right? Because we, in relative terms, hold no power, and they hold all the power\n","842: So they have to be under the tightest constraints we need to be in the freest circumstances\n","843: And yet the rise of the state secrets doctrine, this whole classification system that goes all the way back to last century, about the middle of the last century, I believe, is when it really started getting test in court\n","844: And I think you know more about this in many cases than I do\n","845: When you start talking about what happened in the FBI and the CIA and the NSA's sort of old dirty work in the 20th century, they abused their powers repeatedly and continuously\n","846: They did active harm to domestic politics in the United States\n","847: The FBI was spying on Martin Luther King and trying to get Martin Luther King to kill himself before the Nobel Prize was going to be awarded\n","848: In fact, after MLK gave his I Have a Dream speech two days later, the FBI classified him as the greatest national Earth\n","849: I think it was the greatest national security threat in the United States\n","850: And yet this is the FBI\n","851: This is the group that everybody's applauding today saying all these wonderful patriots and heroes\n","852: Now, I'm not saying everybody the FBI is bad\n","853: I'm not saying everybody at the CIA and the NSA is bad\n","854: I'm saying that you don't become patriot based on where you work\n","855: Patriotism is not about loyalty to government\n","856: Patriotism, in fact, it's not about loyalty to anything\n","857: Patriotism is a constant effort to do good for the people of your country, right? It's not about the government\n","858: It's not about the state\n","859: We'll get into loyalty later because I think one of the big criticisms against me that should be talked about is they go, look, this guy is disloyal\n","860: He broke an oath\n","861: He did whatever\n","862: Loyalty is a good thing when it's in the service of something good, but it is only good when it's in the service of something good\n","863: If you're loyal to a bad person, if you're loyal to a bad program, if you're loyal to a bad government, that loyalty is actively harmful\n","864: And I think that's overlooked\n","865: But, yeah, when you get back into this whole thing about sort of where it came from, why it happened, how it could come out of just this small group, and then they could slowly kind of poison by implication, by complicity, by bringing them into the conspiracy and then having them not say anything about it, a wider and wider broad body of people\n","866: And then once you've got enough people in on it, it's much easier to convince other people that it's legitimate because they can go, look, we've got 30 people who know about this, and none of them have objected to it\n","867: Why are you going to object to this? All of this derives from the original sin, which is, in a democracy, creating a system of government that is, in fact, a secret government, a body of secret law, a body of secret policy that is far beyond what legitimate government secrets could be\n","868: This is not to say, like, government can have no secrecy at all if the government wants to investigate someone without having them respond, right? We're talking traditional law enforcement\n","869: Sure you're not going to tell this mobster, hey, we're going to start investigating you\n","870: We, the public, don't need to know the names of every terrorist\n","871: Suspect out in the world, right? But we do need to know again the powers and programs, the policies that the government is asserting, at least the broad outlines of it, because otherwise, how can we control it? How do we know if the government is applying its authorities that are supposed to be granted to it by us if we don't know what it is that they're doing? This is the main thing\n","872: And really the story behind the title Permanent Record is, look, Joe, when I was a kid, when you were a teenager running, like, what's the worst thing you ever said? Did you say anything you weren't proud of? Did you do anything that you weren't proud of? Something that today, in, like the wokeest of Twitterland, you would get in trouble for, I'm sure\n","873: And that's right\n","874: One of the horrible things about kids growing up today is that they do have all this stuff out there on social media forever, and they can be judged horribly by something they did when they were 13\n","875: It's exactly that\n","876: Our worst mistakes are our deepest shames were forgotten\n","877: They were lost\n","878: They were ephemeral\n","879: Even the things we did get caught for, they were known for a time\n","880: Maybe they're still remembered by people who are closest to us, whether we like them or dislike them\n","881: But there were people connected to us\n","882: Now we're forced to live in a real way, naked before power\n","883: Whether we're talking about Facebook, whether we're talking about Google, whether we're talking about the government of any country, they know everything about us, or much about us, rather, and we know very little about them, and we're not allowed to know more\n","884: Everything that we do now lasts forever, not because we want to remember, but because we're not allowed to forget\n","885: Just carrying a phone in your pocket is enough for your movements to be moralized, because every cell phone tower that you pass is keeping a record of that\n","886: And at and T keeps those records going back to 2008 under a program called Hemisphere\n","887: If you search for Hemisphere and at and T, you'll get a story in the Daily Beast about it\n","888: At Amp\n","889: T keeps your phone records going back to if any of your listeners were born after 1983, right? Born after me\n","890: Or it might be 1987, if they were born after 1987 and they're an at and T customer, or their calls across ATC's network\n","891: At and T has every phone call they ever made, rather the record that it happened, not necessarily the content that's on the phone call\n","892: Let me turn this around for you, Joe, because I feel like I've just been given a speech\n","893: When you look at this stuff, right, when you look at what's happening with government, when you look at what's happening with the Trump White House, the Obama White House, the Bush White House, you could see this trend happening\n","894: When you look at what's happening with Facebook\n","895: When you look at what's happening with Google, when you look at the fact that you go to every restaurant today and you see people looking at phones, you get on a bus, you get on a subway, you see somebody sitting next to you in traffic, you see people looking at phones\n","896: These devices are connected all the time now\n","897: People are getting Alexa right now\n","898: People have OK, Google, they have Siri on their phones that are in their house\n","899: They've always got these connected microphones\n","900: Where do you think this leads, and what is it that gives you sort of trust in the system, faith in the system\n","901: So we can start a conversation here\n","902: What strikes you about this? Well, it's completely alien and it's new\n","903: This is something that's unprecedented\n","904: We don't have a long human history of being completely connected via technology\n","905: This is something we're navigating right now for the first time\n","906: And it's probably the most powerful thing that the human race has ever seen in terms of the distribution of information\n","907: There's nothing that even comes close to it in all of human history\n","908: And we're figuring it out as we go along\n","909: And what you exposed is that not only are we figuring out as we go along, but that to cover their ass, the cell phone companies in cahoots with the government have made it legal for them to gather up all of your phone calls, all of your text messages, all of your emails, and store them somewhere\n","910: So that retroactively\n","911: If you ever say anything they don't like or do something they don't like, they can go back, find that, and use it against you\n","912: And we don't know who they are\n","913: We don't know why they're doing it, and we didn't know they could do it until you exposed it\n","914: The connection of human beings via technology is both amazing and powerful and incredible in terms of our access to knowledge, but terrifying in terms of the government's ability to track our movements, track your phone calls, track everything\n","915: And under the guise of protecting us from terrorists and protecting us from sleeper cells, protecting us from attacks, if they really are protecting us from these attacks, that's great, but there's no provision in the Constitution that allows any of this\n","916: And this is where it gets really squirrely, because they're making up the rules as they go along, and they're making up these rules\n","917: The way you're describing it is, step by step, this has happened to sort of protect their ass and keep themselves from being implicated in what has been a violation of our rights and our privacy and the Fourth Amendment\n","918: Yeah, I mean, I think one of the things that everybody needs to understand when you look at these things and the reason we talked about before when I got this information, why I didn't just put it on the Internet and people criticize me for this they go, I didn't share enough information because the journalists are gatekeeping, right? They've got a big archive, and they haven't published everything from it, and I told them not to publish everything from it\n","919: Why did you do that? Why did you do that? Again, it gets back to legitimate secrets and illegitimate secrets\n","920: Some spying\n","921: From my perspective, career spy is okay, right? Agreed\n","922: If you have hacked a terrorist phone and you're getting some information about that, useful\n","923: Agreed\n","924: Yeah\n","925: If you're spying on a Russian general in charge of a rocket division, useful\n","926: Right\n","927: But there are lines and degrees in that where it's not useful\n","928: Now, the examples that I just gave you, these are targeted\n","929: This is where you're spying on an individual they're known, named person that is being monitored for specific reason that is related, hopefully from a warranty, right? Well, even for foreign intelligence, in some indications, you don't need a warrant strictly, although I think they should have warrants for all of these investigations because they established a court for precisely this reason called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, right? And there's not a judge in the world who wouldn't stamp a warrant saying, hey, spy on Abu Jihad over here, right? And if you want to spy on another guy, boris Badanov of the rocket Division, right, that's okay\n","930: They're going to go with that\n","931: But then you look at these edge cases in the archive that I provided to journalists\n","932: There have been stories that have come out where they've spied on journalists, right? They've spied on human rights groups and these kind of things I think people miss\n","933: I'm going to throw up some slides here, so forgive me if this gets weird and I put up the wrong ones, but since I came forward, this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the government says authorized these programs 15 different times was overruled by the first open courts to look at the program\n","934: These are federal courts here, right, that said, no, actually, these programs are unlawful\n","935: They're likely unconstitutional\n","936: When you start looking at the facts, you see even within the context of the very loose restrictions and laws that apply to the NSA and surveillance, they say they broke their own laws 2776 times in a single year\n","937: And then you ask about that thing that motivates me, like why I came forward\n","938: We had been trying as a country before I came forward to prove the existence of these programs legally, because this is our means of last sort of recourse in our system\n","939: We got the executive, we got the legislature, we got the judiciary\n","940: So Congress makes the laws\n","941: The executive is supposed to carry them out\n","942: The courts are supposed to play referee\n","943: The executive had broken the laws\n","944: Congress was turning a blind eye to the laws, and the courts were\n","945: And this is just months before I came forward going, well, it does appear that the ACLU and Amnesty International like all of these human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations had established that these programs are likely unlawful\n","946: They likely exist, they're simply classified\n","947: But the government responded with this argument that you just saw\n","948: Saying that\n","949: Well\n","950: It's a state secret if they do exist\n","951: You\n","952: The plaintiffs\n","953: Don't have hard\n","954: Concrete evidence that they do exist\n","955: And the government is saying legally\n","956: You have no right to discover evidence from the government\n","957: Write documents\n","958: Demand documents\n","959: And demand and answers from the government as to whether or not these things exist\n","960: Because the government's just going to give its standard what they call global response\n","961: We can neither confirm nor deny that these things exist\n","962: Which leaves you out in the cold, which leaves the courts out in the cold\n","963: The courts go, look, the government could be breaking the law here\n","964: Look, they could be violating the constitution here, but because you can't prove it, and because the government doesn't want to play ball, and the government says if we were doing this, it would be legal and it would be necessary for national security or whatever, the court can't presume to know national security better than the executive because the courts aren't elected\n","965: And so this leads to this fundamentally broken system where, OK, the only way to have the courts review the legality of the programs is to establish the programs exist, but the programs are classified, so you can't establish they exist unless you have evidence\n","966: But providing that evidence to courts, to journalists, to anyone, is a felony\n","967: That's punishable by ten years per count under the espionage act\n","968: And the government has charged every source of public interest journalism who has really made a significant difference in these kind of cases since Daniel Ellsberg, really going back to that under the same espionage act, it's always the same law\n","969: And there's no distinction to government between whether you sold information to a foreign government for private benefit or whether you provided information only to journalists for the public interest\n","970: And then that's a fundamentally harmful thing\n","971: I think when you look at things that have come in the wake of this, we're talking about the post 2013 court rulings that found what the government was doing was unlawful\n","972: You see the courts saying actually that leaks, or air quotes leaks can actually be beneficial\n","973: Leak is used in the governance, and this is from a federal court\n","974: These are not exactly my biggest supporters\n","975: They're recognizing that although leak implies harm, it implies something that's broken\n","976: It's actually helpful\n","977: It's a leak that's letting in daylight in this context, that is the only thing that allows the system to operate in a context where one year before I came forward, we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff didn't happen\n","978: We had hang on this famous exchange, which more than anything made me realize this was a point of no return, because I told you this, you've heard this, but if you haven't seen it, you might not believe me, right? Maybe I'm a sketchy guy\n","979: Whatever\n","980: One of those senators I told you that objected to this stuff, that was doing the Lassie barks for all those years, ron Wyden was confronting the most senior spy in the United States, general James Clapper, who was then the Director of National Intelligence, right? There's no guy higher than him\n","981: The buck stops with him when it comes to intelligence\n","982: He's testifying under oath in front of Congress, right? But more broadly, in front of the public\n","983: This is televised\n","984: And Ron Wyden asked him a very specific question about a program, mind you, that Ron Wyden knows exists because he has security clearance\n","985: He sits on the Intelligence Committee, and he knows there's domestic mass surveillance\n","986: And this is how it goes\n","987: This is how the top spy responds under oath\n","988: So what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question, does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? No, sir, it does not\n","989: Not wittingly\n","990: There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps collect, but not willingly\n","991: So that was a lie\n","992: Widen knew it was a lie\n","993: Clapper knew it was a lie\n","994: He actually admitted it was a lie after I came forward three months later\n","995: But he said it was the least untruthful thing he could think of to say in the context of being in the hot seat there\n","996: But what does it mean for a democracy when you can lie under oath to Congress and the congressman even knows you're lying to them, but they're afraid to correct you? And Wyden, by the way, it wasn't a surprise\n","997: Widen gave him those questions 24 hours in advance, and he wrote a letter afterwards asking for Clapper to amend his testimony, right? Not even at a press conference, but just to say this was incorrect, whatever\n","998: So he could go through the legal process and show his fellow congressman that there was a problem and that they needed to do it\n","999: But all of that was refused to us\n","1000: All of it was denied to us\n","1001: And here I am sitting at the NSA next to my buddies, who I've talked to about these programs\n","1002: I've gone\n","1003: Look at this\n","1004: And they're laughing at it\n","1005: I'm laughing at it\n","1006: And it's not that we go, oh, ha ha, he's getting away with it\n","1007: It's like, what are you going to do? These guys are bullshitters\n","1008: The system is built on lies\n","1009: Even many people, many experts who have studied this know our lies\n","1010: But if you can't prove they are lies, how do you move beyond that? And that's really a question that has never been more relevant than I think it is today under the current White House\n","1011: So you're in this position where you have this information, and you know that these surveillance systems are in place and they are unconstitutional, and you feel this deep responsibility to let the American people know about this\n","1012: What makes you take the leap? So this is covered extensively in the book because it took a long time, I would imagine\n","1013: Yeah, right, exactly\n","1014: People like to think it's like a cinematic moment where I find this golden document like the Stellar Wind Report, and that's the closest thing to a smoking gun that exists\n","1015: But look, if you found that, you can read that later, look at that and imagine yourself being like, oh, I'm going to go outside on the courthouse steps and wave this thing and burn my life to the ground, burn my family to the ground\n","1016: I'm never going to be work again\n","1017: I'm going to jail for the rest of my life\n","1018: The question is, what would it take for you to light a match and burn your life to the ground? For a long time? The answer was nothing\n","1019: And I'm ashamed of that\n","1020: It took me so long to get over that home because I was waiting for somebody else to do it\n","1021: When I saw people like Ron Wyden on this, when I saw people like the court case that I showed before, where people were actively challenging these programs, right\n","1022: Journalists had the scent of it\n","1023: And there are a lot of people who are going to be in the YouTube comments or whatever and go, oh, I knew this was happening\n","1024: No, you didn't\n","1025: Well, Bill Bimini, you had Benny excuse me, bill Bini, he initially was the one that came out and spoke about this issue\n","1026: Yeah, bill Benny is part of, shall we say, the group of early NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas Drake\n","1027: Bill benny Kirk Weby\n","1028: I believe in Ed Loomis\n","1029: And these guys all got their doors kicked in\n","1030: They got harassed by the FBI\n","1031: Tom Drake, who was a senior executive at the NSA, this is a guy who had a lot to lose, was charged under the same law was the Espionage Act\n","1032: And these guys who were doing it earlier during the Bush administration, some of them were talking to the journalists\n","1033: Maybe it's alleged\n","1034: I don't want to put them on the spot\n","1035: Maybe they deny it, maybe they don't\n","1036: Leave that to them\n","1037: But somebody somewhere was informing this reporting that got into the New York Times about the Bush era warrantless wiretapping program\n","1038: And eventually journalists put this out there\n","1039: People knew these capabilities existed\n","1040: But yes, then there's the person in the YouTube comments\n","1041: It's like, oh, we knew all about this\n","1042: It's nothing new\n","1043: And the thing is, you can know about some programs and not know about others\n","1044: You can have a suspicion\n","1045: You can know with certainty that this stuff is capable or it is possible the capability exists\n","1046: You can know that the government has done this stuff in the past\n","1047: You can know they are likely to do it again you can have all these indications\n","1048: You can have like the Jewel versus NSA case that's run by the EFF which is about at and T setting up secret rooms in their telecommunications facilities where they basically drag all the fibers for their domestic internet communications and like phone communications into a room that's purpose built for the NSA and then they bring it out\n","1049: But at and T denies it's\n","1050: The NSA, the NSA denies that these things happen or that are done at all\n","1051: Right? And so this is the context\n","1052: You say, you know and let's put it the other way maybe you do know, right? Maybe you are an academic researcher or maybe you're a technological specialist\n","1053: Maybe you're just somebody who reads all the reporting and you actually know you can't prove it but you know this is going on\n","1054: But that's the thing in a democracy the distance between speculation and fact, the distance between what you know and what you can prove to everybody else in the country is everything in our model of government\n","1055: Because what you know doesn't matter\n","1056: What matters is what we all know\n","1057: And the only way we can all know it is if somebody can prove it\n","1058: If you can prove it and if you don't have the evidence, you can't prove it\n","1059: And of course when we talk about the earlier stuff, right, like a more corporatized media, they've got 1000 incentives not to get involved in this stuff\n","1060: They need access to the White House\n","1061: They need these officials to sit down with them and give interviews, right? That's constant content that they need, that's access that they need\n","1062: They need to be taken seriously\n","1063: They need to be admitted to briefers\n","1064: It is a codependent relationship rather\n","1065: And so the only way to make sure people understand this broadly is if we all work together\n","1066: If we collectively can establish a corpus of evidence, a body of facts that is so large and so persuasive it overcomes the natural and understandable resistance of these more corporatized media groups\n","1067: It overcomes the political and partisan sort of loyalties that all of these political factions in the country do\n","1068: Where they go it's my president\n","1069: Even if I don't like this stuff, even if I don't agree with this stuff, I don't want to say it exists\n","1070: I want to deny it until it's proved in HD on video signing the order to do this or the other because otherwise there's a chance my guy might not get reelected\n","1071: And that's the only way this kind of stuff can happen\n","1072: And the sad fact is the opportunities that we have to prove this, like the moments in history where we do prove something, anything beyond a reasonable doubt are so few and so rare that they almost always only come from whistleblowers\n","1073: And I think that's one of the problems that we have, particularly in the climate movement\n","1074: Go ahead\n","1075: I'm sorry, did you take any comfort from knowing that Obama, when he was running for office and in his Hope and Change website, he had provisions to protect whistleblowers and provisions to reward people, right? I mean, do you remember all that? It was eventually redacted or eventually deleted\n","1076: It from the website, but that appeared\n","1077: It from Google, but that was a big part of his program, or what he was running on was that when people were exposing unlawful activity, he was going to protect those people\n","1078: Did you take any comfort in that? He also campaigned well, obama also during his campaign said he campaigned actively against the warrantless wiretapping, the Bush administration, because, remember, Bush is in the scandal\n","1079: The height of this in 2007\n","1080: The election is coming up right after, and he's going, obama's saying, that's not who we are\n","1081: That's not what we do\n","1082: And yet, within 100 days of him becoming president, now he's sitting in that chair\n","1083: Rather than extinguishing these programs, he embraces them and expands\n","1084: Why do you think that is more entrenched? I think it's actually, again, what we talked about earlier, first thing, every time a new president comes into the White House, they get their clearances\n","1085: They get read into all this stuff\n","1086: During the campaign, they get clearances and they get rid of stuff\n","1087: But when they finally become president, right now they're the only people who can sign what these are called the Covert Action Findings and things like that, which are basically the intelligence community wants to assassinate somebody\n","1088: They want to run this illegal program here, there, or everywhere, and they can't do it because they're executive agencies without that top level executive sign off\n","1089: And so they got to open the vest, right? They got to get these guys on side\n","1090: And basically, every president since Kennedy, they have been successful in what they call fearingup, where as soon as they come in, they read you the litany of horribles\n","1091: They go, These are all the threats that we're facing, and let's be real\n","1092: It is a dangerous world\n","1093: It's not just all made up BS\n","1094: Some of it is where it's inflated\n","1095: It's not that it's completely false, but they make it sound more serious than it actually is\n","1096: But there are real bad people out there who are trying to do real bad things, and you have just gone through a hellish election because our electoral politics are so diseased\n","1097: And now after you've crawled through fire, you're already thinking, four years ahead, how do I stay in this seat? And these guys are basically saying, if you don't do X, Y, and Z, this is going to fall on your lap\n","1098: And the implication, which I don't think they actually say, but every president knows, is these guys can undermine you to death if you've got the IC against you, right? They can stonewall you\n","1099: They can put out stories that are going to be problematic for you every day in your presidency\n","1100: And it's not that it's necessarily going to cast you out of the White House, but it's a problem that, as a president, you very much don't want\n","1101: So in the most charitable interpretation of this, you've got a new guy coming\n","1102: In Obama's case, this is a pretty young guy, doesn't focus on this kind of national security, foreign policy stuff throughout his earlier career\n","1103: He's more interested in domestic policy\n","1104: No, he has been\n","1105: That's actually one of the positive things to say about Barack Obama\n","1106: He's just trying to make things better at home\n","1107: And now suddenly they go, look, you need to worry about this country\n","1108: You need to worry about this group that you've never heard of, you need to worry about this technology, you need to do all this stuff\n","1109: And the only reason we can tell you this stuff and the only thing dividing America and the abyss are these terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible programs, right, that are in fact wonderful things because they keep back the darkness\n","1110: And so here's the real problem\n","1111: Every president hears that and every president first off, they've got so many other things to do, they just kind of nod their head and they'll go, I'll deal with this later in my administration\n","1112: And this is one of the ironies when I came forward in 2013\n","1113: This is now Barack Obama's second term president\n","1114: One of the responses that they had to the mass surveillance scandal was, yes, we think they went a little too far\n","1115: This is after the initial thing where they went, nobody's listening to your phone calls, just made a data, right? Nobody can have perfect privacy and also have perfect security\n","1116: So we got a sort of divide a line here between the Constitution and, you know, what the government wants to do\n","1117: But they said we were going to get to it\n","1118: We knew these programs were problematic, but if they just gave us more time, we would have fixed them\n","1119: Maybe it's true, right? Seems awful convenient in hindsight throughout the entirety of the first term\n","1120: Well, it seems like what you would say if you got caught, right? But look, if we're being the most generous that we are here, the President is briefed on real and legitimate threats and they scare the hell out of them, I'm sure\n","1121: And we can all imagine being there, right? Those of us who remember what the world was like post 911\n","1122: Fear is a powerful thing\n","1123: But the guys who are doing that briefing, they're no longer scared of it because they've been dealing with this for years\n","1124: This is the oldest thing\n","1125: They've given this briefing times before\n","1126: When people talk about the deep state, they talk about it like some conspiracy of lizard people\n","1127: It's not that\n","1128: It's something much simpler\n","1129: The deep state is simply the career government\n","1130: It's the people who are in the same offices who outlive and outlast presidencies, right? They've seen Republicans they've seen Democrats, they don't really care\n","1131: And they give that same briefing again and again, and they get good at it\n","1132: They know what they want\n","1133: They know what this person is saying\n","1134: Where's the President? They don't know who these people are\n","1135: These people have been there before the President\n","1136: They're going to be there after the President\n","1137: And so they give this very effective, very fear inducing speech and then they followed up with their asks, which are really demands just politely provided\n","1138: And anyone in that position who is not an expert on this stuff, who is not ready for this sort of tradeoff, and who you have to understand as a career politician is entirely used to the horse trading game going, I'll deal with this later, or not now, or what are the cost benefit here? And the intelligence community goes, if you give us what we want, no one will ever know about it because it's classified\n","1139: It's obviously the easy answer\n","1140: And maybe Barack Obama honestly did want to get to this later\n","1141: But what we can say today is for all the good that may have been done in that White House, this is an issue where the President went through two full terms and did not fix the problem, but in fact made it worse\n","1142: Well, it seems like the President has a job that's absolutely impossible\n","1143: And if you come across someone who has been in the position, like someone who's the head of an intelligence agency for a long time and is very persuasive and has some legitimate credentials that show that he's very good at his job, but he tells you this is important for national security\n","1144: We need to keep these things in place\n","1145: It doesn't seem like any one person can run the country and be aware of every single program that every single agency is implementing\n","1146: It seems completely unrealistic\n","1147: And the job itself, it doesn't seem like any person can do it adequately\n","1148: And when it comes to something like this mass surveillance state, I could see a President being persuaded by someone who comes to him and says, this is why we need to do this\n","1149: One of the things that I think is the underlying problem and everything that you just described is the President has too much power, right? And because they have too much power, that means they have too much responsibility\n","1150: And I don't think people understand if they haven't lived outside the United States, if they haven't sort of traveled or studied broadly, just how exceptional the American presidency is\n","1151: Most countries don't have a single individual with this level of power\n","1152: It's really only the superstates\n","1153: And that may be by design, perhaps that's why they're super states\n","1154: But when we look at sort of complex, advanced democracies that are more peaceful, they tend to have a more multilateral system that has more people involved in smaller portfolios\n","1155: And a lot of this derives from just\n","1156: The size of the government\n","1157: Like you said, you know, the president is responsible for basically everything executive branch, and the executive branch is basically every agency that actually doesn't work\n","1158: And so how do you correct for that without breaking it up? Where you have smaller ministers and ministries and things like that that have different levels of responsibility? Having a smaller government overall, back in 1776, the federal government was pretty much a dream\n","1159: We weren't even interested in having standing armies\n","1160: The idea of an army that existed from year to year was a terrifying, forbidding thing\n","1161: And then when you moved this idea that we have a president, that they have these extraordinary powers, it's okay because the government is very small\n","1162: The federal government especially, is seen as sort of this small and toothless and weak thing\n","1163: Pause for 1 second\n","1164: Pause for 1 second, because my ear pods are about to die, and I'm going to swap over to another pair\n","1165: These structures are good for a couple of hours, but we're 2 hours and 15 minutes here\n","1166: We'll have a little bit of a weird audio issue with the last half of it, but Jamie will take care of it\n","1167: I wanted to talk about you, where you are right now in your life and how you're handling this, because you've been in exile for how many years now? It's been more than six years\n","1168: June of 2013\n","1169: Yeah\n","1170: Well, actually, I left May\n","1171: What is life like? Are you in constant hiding? What are the issues like? In the beginning, my operational security level, as we would call it, was very high\n","1172: I was concerned about being recognized\n","1173: I was concerned about being followed\n","1174: I was concerned, really, about very bad things happening to me, because the government made it very clear that from their position, I was the most wanted man in the world\n","1175: They literally brought down the president of Bolivia, his aircraft, and would not let it depart as it tried to cross the airspace of Europe, not even the United States\n","1176: They wouldn't let it leave until they confirmed I was not on board\n","1177: So, yeah, that made me a little bit nervous\n","1178: But you can't live like that forever\n","1179: And although I was as careful as I could be, I still lived pretty happily because I was an indoor cat to begin with\n","1180: Right\n","1181: I've always been a technologist\n","1182: I've always been pretty nerdy\n","1183: So as long as I have a screen and internet connection, I was pretty happy\n","1184: But in the years past, my life has become more and more open\n","1185: Now I speak openly, I live openly\n","1186: I go out, I ride the metro, I go to restaurants\n","1187: How often do you recognize? So this is a funny thing, is I'm almost never recognized\n","1188: One of those things is I don't give Russian interviews because I don't want my face all over the news, which is nice, because it just allows people to sort of forget about my face, and I can go about my life\n","1189: But it's one of the weird things that I'm recognized a couple times a year, even when I'm not wearing my glasses in a museum or a grocery store or something like that, or out on the street just by somebody who I swear, like these people are\n","1190: You might have read a story about them, like, super recognizers the people who just have a great memory for faces\n","1191: Yeah, because I can be, like, wearing a hood and, like, a jacket\n","1192: It can have a scarf around my face, like in the winter, and you can barely see my face\n","1193: And they'll come up to me and they're like, Are you snowden? And I'm like, Whoa\n","1194: What do you say? Pretty impressive\n","1195: I'd say, yeah, it's nice to meet you\n","1196: I've never had a negative interaction from being recognized, but for me, because I'm a privacy advocate, I would much rather go unrecognized\n","1197: Like, I don't want to be a celebrity\n","1198: But the other thing is, I'll get recognized in computer stores, and I think there's just, like, a mental association where people are like their brain\n","1199: When it's cycling through faces that are recognizes, it's going through, like, the subset of nerdier people or something like that when you're in a computer store\n","1200: Because for whatever reason, I'm recognized much more frequently when there's some kind of technological locus\n","1201: So you're living freely\n","1202: You had to learn Russian\n","1203: Did you learn it? Yeah, my Russian is still pretty crappy, to my great shame, because all of my life, all of my work is primarily an increase right now\n","1204: You've talked about returning home\n","1205: If you could get a fair trial\n","1206: Is that a feasible thing, a fair trial for someone like you? Is that such a well, yeah\n","1207: Is that even possible question? I mean, look, if we're being frank, I think all your audience knows the chance of me getting a fair shake in the Eastern District of Virginia, a couple of miles from the headquarters of the CIA is probably pretty slim because that's where they draw the jury pool from\n","1208: But my objection here is on a larger principle\n","1209: What happens to me is less important if I spend the rest of my life in jail\n","1210: That's less important than what I'm actually requiring the government to agree to, which is a single thing\n","1211: Right? They say, Face the music, face the music\n","1212: And I'm saying, Great, let's pick the song\n","1213: The thing is\n","1214: The law that I've been charged under\n","1215: The one that all these whistleblowers have been charged under\n","1216: Thomas Drake\n","1217: Daniel Ellsberg\n","1218: Chelsea Manning\n","1219: Daniel Hale\n","1220: The drone whistleblower who is in prison right now going through a trial that is precisely similar to what I would be facing\n","1221: His lawyer is asking the court or telling the court that we want to tell the jury why he did what he did\n","1222: That the government is violating laws\n","1223: The government is violating human rights, that these programs are immoral, that they're unethical\n","1224: This is what motivated this guy to do it\n","1225: And the jury should be able to hear why he did what he did, and the jury should be able to decide whether that was right or wrong\n","1226: And the government has responded to this whistleblower argument, basically saying, we demand the court forbid this guy from breathing the word whistleblower in court\n","1227: He cannot talk about what motivated him\n","1228: He cannot talk about what was revealed, why it was revealed, what the impacts and effects were\n","1229: He can't talk about whether the public benefited from it or was harmed by it, because it doesn't matter\n","1230: Now, this might surprise a lot of people, because to a lot of us, we think that's what a jury trial is\n","1231: We think that's what a fair trial is\n","1232: But the Espionage Act that the government uses against whistleblowers, meaning broadly here, the sources of journalism, is fairly unique in the legal system in that it is what's called a strict liability crime\n","1233: A strict liability crime is what the government considers to be basically a crime worse than murder\n","1234: Because if you murdered somebody, like if you just, I don't know, beat Jamie with the microphone stand right now, you would be able to go to the court and say it was self defense, right? Like you felt threatened, you were in danger for your life\n","1235: Even if you weren't, even if you obviously weren't, even if you were on tape, you could still argue that, and the jury could go, you're full of crap, right, and they could convict you\n","1236: But if you were in fact acting in self defense, if the jury did in fact believe you, they could take that into consideration in establishing their verdict, right? Strict liability crimes forbid that\n","1237: The jury is not allowed to consider why you committed a crime\n","1238: They are only allowed to consider if you committed a crime\n","1239: They are not allowed to consider if the murder was justified\n","1240: They are only allowed to consider if the murder took place\n","1241: And the funny thing in this case is that the murder that we're talking about is telling the truth\n","1242: The Espionage Act in every case is a law the government exclusively uses against people who told the truth\n","1243: Right? That's what it's about in the context of journalism\n","1244: They don't bring the Espionage Act against people who lied\n","1245: Then they would use fraud or some other statute\n","1246: They say the government is arguing in the context of whistleblowing that telling an important truth to the American people by way of a journalist is a crime worse than murder\n","1247: And I believe, and I think most Americans would agree this is fundamentally indefensibly wrong\n","1248: And so my whole argument with the United States government since the very beginning has been, I'll be back for a jury trial tomorrow, but you have to agree to permit whistleblowers a public interest defense\n","1249: It doesn't matter whether they are a whistleblower or not\n","1250: It's just they argued\n","1251: It's the jury that decides whether they are a whistleblower or not\n","1252: They have to be able to consider the motivations of why someone did what they did\n","1253: The government says, we refuse to allow that because that puts the government on trial, and we don't trust the jury to consider those questions\n","1254: Wow, so you have had these conversations then? So this has been discussed? No, this is from the Obama administration\n","1255: There's been no contact since the Trump administration because the government basically, when they got to this point, they went, we have no good argument against this, and we will never permit this to happen\n","1256: And again, I just want to make clear this is not speculation\n","1257: This is not me thinking\n","1258: This is actively happening\n","1259: In the case of Daniel Hale right now, I hope you guys can pull up a graphic for it, because this story just at the papers, like two or three weeks ago saying the government is forbidding this guy from making this argument\n","1260: So you're seemingly in a state of limbo then\n","1261: They're not actively pursuing you\n","1262: It seems that if you're able to move around freely, they haven't discovered where you are\n","1263: You're just free to live your life\n","1264: Well\n","1265: Yeah, it's one of these things where whether they know where I am or whether they don't know where I am, where I put my head on the pillow, it doesn't matter so much I'm in Russia\n","1266: We should lean into that because I think people, they hear Russia, particularly in the context of today's news, and you see, like, what people are saying about Tulsi Gabbard and things like that\n","1267: Association\n","1268: Anytime your name appears in the same sentence, the paragraph, same story is the word Russia\n","1269: It's considered a negative thing now, and don't get me wrong, I've been a longtime critic of the Russian government\n","1270: I just actually had a major story written about me in a Russian state news outlet called Riya Novosti\n","1271: You guys could probably pull it\n","1272: It's only in Russian, though, that's saying, because I spoke favorably about a member of the Russian opposition, Alexey Navalny, which I wasn't even speaking positively about this guy\n","1273: I was saying, Look, I think people have a right to express their opposition in a country, and they should be able to do that without fearing retaliation in the future\n","1274: Because the background here is this opposition figure has been a long time thorn in the Russian administration side, and they've just suddenly, magically been accused of being foreign agents or something like that\n","1275: And so everyone connected to this, which is like a big civil society body, had their doors simultaneously kicked in across the country, and they are being investigated for some kind of corruption or something\n","1276: It doesn't even matter\n","1277: And I said, I suppose that just like I was tweeting footage of ballot stuffing in the Russian elections, just like I've criticized the Russian president by name\n","1278: I've criticized Russian surveillance laws, so many things, again and again and again and again and again\n","1279: But, yeah, so, look, it does not make my life easier to be trapped in a country that I did not choose\n","1280: And people don't remember this\n","1281: I was actually en route to Latin America when the US\n","1282: Government canceled my passport, which trapped me in Russia\n","1283: And for those who are interested, again, I wrote an entire book that has a lot of detail on this\n","1284: But, yeah, it's difficult to be basically engaged in civil opposition to policies of the United States government at the same time as the Russian government\n","1285: And it's a hard thing\n","1286: It's not a happy thing, but I feel like it's a necessary thing\n","1287: The problem is nobody wants to talk about that\n","1288: Nobody wants to engage in that kind of nuance\n","1289: Nobody wants to consider those kind of conversations in the current world\n","1290: People believe and this is actually one of the worst things that Western media does in the context of discussing Russia is they create this aura of invincibility around the Russian president\n","1291: They go, this guy's calling all the shots\n","1292: He's pulling all the strings\n","1293: This guy's in charge of the world\n","1294: And that's very useful for the Russian government broadly, because they can then take that and replay that on their domestic media, and they can go, look how strong we are\n","1295: The Americans are afraid of us\n","1296: The Chinese are afraid of us\n","1297: Everybody's afraid of us\n","1298: The French are afraid of us\n","1299: We are strong\n","1300: Right? There's no question that Russia is going to be interfering in elections\n","1301: There's no question that America is going to be interfering in Russian elections\n","1302: Right\n","1303: Nobody likes to talk about this\n","1304: And again, I need to substantiate that\n","1305: Now that I've said that, I've got an old note that I've decided a billion times\n","1306: The New York Times published a story in the wake of this contestant 2016 election where they looked into the history of electoral interference in Russia and the Soviet Union, and they found, in roughly 50 years, 36 different cases of election interference by Russia or the Soviets\n","1307: This is not a new thing\n","1308: This is something that always happens because that's what intelligence services do\n","1309: That's what they think they're being paid for, which is a sad thing, but it's a reality because we aren't wise enough to separate covert action from intelligence gathering\n","1310: But in that same study that they found 36 different cases by the Russians and the Soviets, they found 81 different cases by the US\n","1311: And this was published by Scott Shane and the New York Times and both the Washington Post as well\n","1312: But this is the thing\n","1313: Like, there is a way to criticize the Russian government's policies without criticizing the Russian people who are ordinary people who just want to have a happy life\n","1314: They just want to do better\n","1315: They want the same things that you do, right? And every time people go, oh, Russia, Russia, Russia\n","1316: Every time people go, Russia bad\n","1317: Every time they go, Russia is doing this, they go, Russia's doing that\n","1318: Russian people who have nothing to do with the government feel implicated by that\n","1319: Do you feel like you're in charge of Donald Trump? Do you want to have Donald Trump's legacy around your neck? And then people go, oh, well, you could overthrow Donald Trump, you could overthrow Putin\n","1320: Can you really? Like, is that how it works? Look, I have no affiliation\n","1321: I have no love for the Russian government\n","1322: It's not my choice to be here\n","1323: And I've made it very clear I would be happy to return home\n","1324: Is there any concern that they would deny you visa? How are you staying there? It's a good question\n","1325: So I have a permanent residence\n","1326: People think I'm under, silent, but I'm no longer under\n","1327: It's like a green card now\n","1328: It's going to be renewed every three years\n","1329: So, yeah, sure, it's possible they could kick me out\n","1330: And this was what the story I was telling you about before Russian media was they were saying the Russian government should take some action against me or I shouldn't be welcome here, I should go home because why is he criticizing the Russian government right? When they're the people? Is that like the Russian version of Fox News? Is that what they have over there? I don't know enough about Russian media to tell you\n","1331: I think it's supposed to be more like a Reuters or Associated Press, but the hell if I know\n","1332: But the thing is this, what's the alternative? Yes, the Russian government could screw me, but they could screw me even if I didn't say anything, and so should I shut up and be quiet in the face of things that I think are injustices because it makes me safer? Well, a lot of Pragmatic people will say, yeah, they say You've done enough\n","1333: They say You've done your part\n","1334: They say, Whatever\n","1335: Be safe, live long, be happy\n","1336: But I didn't come forward to be safe\n","1337: If I wanted to be safe, I'd still be sitting in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of money to spy on all of you, right? And nobody ever would have known about this\n","1338: The system would have gotten worse\n","1339: But the system, the world, the future gets worse\n","1340: Every day that we don't do something about it, every day that we stay silent about all the injustices we see, the world gets worse, things get worse\n","1341: And yeah, it's risky, yeah, it's uncomfortable, but that's why we do it\n","1342: Because if we don't, no one else will\n","1343: All those years, I was sitting hoping for someone else to come forward, and no one did that's because I was waiting for a hero\n","1344: But there are no heroes\n","1345: There's only heroic decisions\n","1346: You are never further than one decision away from making a difference\n","1347: It doesn't matter whether there's a big difference, it doesn't matter if it was a small difference, because you don't have to save the world by yourself\n","1348: In fact, you can't\n","1349: All you have to do is lay down one brick\n","1350: All you have to do is make things a little bit better in a small way so that other people can lay their brick on top of that or beside it\n","1351: And together, step by step, day by day, year by year, we build the foundation of something better\n","1352: But, yeah, it's not going to be safe, but it doesn't matter because individually, it's not me\n","1353: Whoever you are, that's the Iron Man\n","1354: I don't care if you're the biggest doomsday prepper with cans full of beans\n","1355: If the world ends, it's going to affect you\n","1356: We make things better\n","1357: We become safe together, right? Collectively, that is our strength\n","1358: That is the power of civilization\n","1359: That is the power that shapes the future\n","1360: Because even if you make life great for you, you're going to die someday\n","1361: You're going to be forgotten\n","1362: Someday your cans of beans are going to rot\n","1363: Someday you can make things safer, you can be more careful, you can be more clever, and there's nothing wrong with that\n","1364: But at the end of the day, you have to recognize if you're trying to eliminate all risks from your life, what you're actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life\n","1365: You're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes such that what you've lost is freedom\n","1366: You've lost the ability to act because you're afraid\n","1367: That's a beautiful way to get us into this mess\n","1368: That's a beautiful way to put it\n","1369: Are you aware at all of the current state of surveillance and what, if anything, has changed since your revelations? Yeah, the big thing that's changed since I was in 2013 is now it's mobile\n","1370: First, everything mobile was still a big deal, right? And the intelligence community was very much grappling to get its hands around it and to deal with it\n","\n","1371: But now people are much less likely to use a laptop and use a desktop and use got any kind of wired phone, then they already use a smartphone\n","1372: And both Apple and Android devices, unfortunately, are not especially good in protecting your privacy\n","1373: Think right now you got a smartphone, right? You might be listening to this on a train somewhere in traffic right now, or you Joe, right now you got a phone somewhere in the room, right? The phone is turned off, or at least the screen is turned off\n","1374: It's sitting there, it's powered on, and if somebody sends you a message, the screen blinks to life\n","1375: How does that happen? How is it that if someone from any corner of the earth dials a number, your phone rings and nobody else's rings? How is it you can dial anybody else's number and only their phone rings? Right? Every smartphone, every phone at all is constantly connected to the nearest cellular tower\n","1376: Every phone, even when the screen is off, you think it's doing nothing\n","1377: You can't see it because radio frequency emissions are invisible\n","1378: It's screaming in the air saying, Here I am, here I am\n","1379: Here is my IMEI\n","1380: I think it's individual manufacturer's, equipment, identity and IMEI\n","1381: Individual manufacturers subscriber identity\n","1382: I could be wrong on the breakout there, but the acronyms are the IMEI and the IMSI\n","1383: And you can search for these things\n","1384: They're two globally unique identifiers that only exist anywhere in the world in one place\n","1385: It makes your phone different than all the other phones\n","1386: The IMEI is burned into the handset of your phone\n","1387: No matter what SIM card you change to, it's always going to be the same and it's always going to be telling the phone network, it's this physical handset\n","1388: Then the Imesi is in your SIM card and this is what holds your phone number, right? It's basically the key, the right to use that phone number\n","1389: And so your phone is sitting there doing nothing\n","1390: You think, but it's constantly shouting and saying, I'm here\n","1391: Who is closest to me? That's a cellphone tower\n","1392: And every cell phone tower with its big ears is listening for these little cries for help and going, all right, I see Joe Rogan's phone, I see Jamie's phone, I see all these phones that are here right now\n","1393: And it compares notes with the other network towers and your smartphone compares notes with them to go, who do I hear the loudest? And who you hear the loudest is a proxy for proximity, for closeness, distance, right? They go, whoever I hear more loudly than anybody else that's close to me\n","1394: So you're going to be bound to the cell phone tower, and that cell phone tower is going to make a note, a permanent record, saying, this phone handset with this phone number at this time was connected to me\n","1395: Right? And based on your phone handset and your phone number, they can get your identity, right, because you pay for this stuff with your credit card and everything like that\n","1396: And even if you don't, it's still active at your house overnight, it's still active on your nightstand when you're sleeping\n","1397: It's still whatever\n","1398: The movements of your phone are the movements of you as a person, and those are often quite uniquely identifying\n","1399: It goes to your home, it goes to your workplace\n","1400: Other people don't have it\n","1401: Sorry\n","1402: Anyway, it's constantly shouting this out and then it compares notes with the other apart from the network\n","1403: And when somebody is trying to get to a phone, it compares notes of the network, compares notes to go, where is this phone with this phone number in the world right now? And to that cell phone tower that is closest to that phone\n","1404: It sends out a signal saying, we have a call for you\n","1405: Make your phone start ringing\n","1406: So your owner can answer it, and then it connects it across this whole path\n","1407: But what this means is that whenever you're carrying a phone, whenever the phone is turned on, there is a record of your presence at that place that is being made and created by companies\n","1408: It does not need to be kept forever, and in fact, there's no good argument for it to be kept forever, but these companies see that as valuable information\n","1409: This is the whole big data problem that we're running into\n","1410: And all this information, that used to be Ephemeral, right? Where were you when you were eight years old? Where'd you go after you had a bad breakup? Who did you spend the night with? Who'd you call? After all, this information used to be ephemeral, meaning it disappeared, right? Like the morning dew\n","1411: It would be gone\n","1412: No one would remember it\n","1413: But now these things are stored\n","1414: Now these things are saved\n","1415: It doesn't matter whether you're doing anything wrong\n","1416: It doesn't matter whether you're the most ordinary person on Earth, because that's how bulk collection, which is the government's euphemism for mass surveillance, works\n","1417: They simply collect it all in advance in hopes that one day it will become useful\n","1418: And that was just talking about how you connect to the phone network\n","1419: That's not talking about all those apps on your phone that are contacting the network even more frequently, right? How do you get a text message notification? How do you get an email notification? How is it Facebook knows where you're at? All of these things, these analytics, they are trying to keep track through location services on your phone, through GPS, through even just what wireless access points you're connected to\n","1420: Because there's a global, constantly updated map, there's actually many of them of wireless access points in the world\n","1421: Because, just like we talked about, every phone has a unique Identifier that's globally unique\n","1422: Every wireless access point in the world, right? Your cable modem at home, whether it's in your laptop, every device that has a radio modem has a globally unique Identifier in it\n","1423: And this is a standard term\n","1424: You can look it up\n","1425: And these things can be mapped when they're broadcasting in the air\n","1426: Because, again, like your phone says to the cell phone tower, I have this Identifier, the cell phone tower responds and says, I have this Identifier\n","1427: And anybody who's listening, they can write these things down\n","1428: And all those Google Street View cars that go back and forth, they're keeping notes on whose WiFi is active on this block, and then they build a new giant map\n","1429: So even if you have GPS turned off, as long as you connect the WiFi, those apps can go, well, I'm connected to Joe's WiFi, but I can also see his neighbor's WiFi here, and the other one in this apartment over here, and the other one in the apartment here\n","1430: And you should only be able to hear those four globally unique WiFi access points from these points in physical space, right? The intersection in between the spreads, the domes of all those wireless access points, and it's a proxy for location\n","1431: And it just goes on and on and on\n","1432: We can talk about this for four more hours\n","1433: We don't have that kind of time\n","1434: Can I ask you this? Is there a way to mitigate any of this personally? I mean, shutting your phone off doesn't even work, right? Well, it does in a way\n","1435: It's yes and no\n","1436: The thing with shutting your phone off that is risk is how do you know your phone's actually turned off? When I was in Geneva, for example, working for the CIA, we would all carry, like, drug dealer phones, the old smartphones, sorry, old dumb phones\n","1437: They're not smartphones\n","1438: And the reason why was just because they had removable batteries where you could take the battery outright\n","1439: And the one beautiful thing about technology is if there's no electricity in it, right, if there's no go juice available to it, if there's no battery connected to it, it's not sending anything, because you have to get power from somewhere\n","1440: You have to have power in order to do work\n","1441: But now your phones are all sealed, right? You can't take the batteries out\n","1442: So there are potential ways that you can hack a phone where it appears to be off, but it's not actually off, it's just pretending to be off, whereas, in fact, it's still listening in and doing all this stuff, but for the average person, that doesn't apply, right? And I got to tell you guys, they've been chasing me all over the place\n","1443: I don't worry about that stuff, right? And it's because if they're applying that level of effort to me, they'll probably get the same information through other routes\n","1444: I am as careful as I can, and I use things like ferretic cages, I turn devices off\n","1445: But if they're actually manipulating the way devices display, it's just too great a level of effort, even for someone like me, to keep that up on a constant basis\n","1446: Also, if they get me, I only trust phones so much, so there's only so much they can derive from the compromise\n","1447: And this is how operational security works\n","1448: You think about what are the realistic threats that you're facing that you're trying to mitigate? And the mitigation that you're trying to do is what would be the loss, what would be the damage done to you if this stuff was exploited? Much more realistic than worrying about these things that I call voodoo hacks, right, which are like next level stuff and actually just a shout out for those of your readers who are interested in this stuff\n","1449: I wrote a paper on this specific problem\n","1450: How do you know when a phone is actually off? How do you know when it's actually not? Spying on you with a brilliant, brilliant guy\n","1451: Named Andrew Bunny Huang\n","1452: He's an MIT PhD in, I think, electrical engineering called the introspection engine that was published in the journal of open engineering\n","1453: You can find it online, and it will go as deep down in the weeds, I promise you, as you want\n","1454: We take an iPhone six\n","1455: This was back when it was fairly new, and we modified it so we could actually not trust the device to report its own state, but physically monitor its state to see if it was spying on you\n","1456: But for average people, right, this academic, that's not your primary threat\n","1457: Your primary threats are these bulk collection programs\n","1458: Your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to these cell phone towers\n","1459: It's doing all of these things because we leave our phones in a state that is constantly on you're constantly connected, right? Airplane mode doesn't even turn off WiFi, really anymore\n","1460: It just turns off the cellular modem\n","1461: But the whole idea is we need to identify the problem\n","1462: And the central problem with smartphone use today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing at any given time\n","1463: Like, the phone has the screen off, you don't know what it's connected to, you don't know how frequently it's doing it\n","\n","1464: Apple and iOS, unfortunately, makes it impossible to see what kind of network connections are constantly made on the device and to intermediate them going, I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now\n","1465: I don't want google to be able to talk right now\n","1466: I just want my secure messenger app to be able to talk\n","1467: I just want my weather app to be able to talk\n","1468: But I just checked my weather, and now I'm done with it\n","1469: So I don't want that to be able to talk anymore\n","1470: And we need to be able to make these intelligent decisions on not just an app by app basis, but a connection by connection basis, right? Let's say you use Facebook because for whatever judgment we have, a lot of people might do it\n","1471: You want it to be able to connect to Facebook's content servers\n","1472: You want to be able to message a friend\n","1473: You want to be able to download a photograph or whatever, but you don't want it to be able to talk to an ad server\n","1474: You don't want it to talk to an analytics server that's monitoring your behavior, right? You don't want to talk to all these third party things because facebook crammed their garbage into almost every app that you download, and you don't even know what's happening because you can't see it\n","\n","1475: Right? And this is the problem with the data collection used today, is there is an industry that is built on keeping this invisible\n","1476: And what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices, whether it's a phone, whether it's computer, or whatever, more visible and understandable to the average person and then give them control over it\n","1477: If you could see your phone right now, and at the very center of it is a little green icon that's your handset, or it's a picture of your face, whatever, and then you see all these little spokes coming off of it\n","1478: That's every app that your phone is talking to right now, or every app that is active on your phone right now and all of the hosts that it's connecting to\n","1479: And you can see right now, once every 3 seconds your phone is checking into Facebook and you could just poke that app and then boom\n","1480: It's not talking to Facebook anymore\n","1481: Facebook is not allowed\n","1482: Facebook speaking privileges have been revoked\n","1483: Right? You would do that? We would all do that\n","1484: If there was a button on your phone that said do what I want but not spy on me, you would press that button, right? That button does not exist right now\n","1485: And both Google and Apple, unfortunately Apple is a lot better at this than Google, but neither of them allow that button to exist\n","1486: In fact, they actively interfere with it because they say it's a security risk\n","1487: And from a particular perspective, they actually aren't wrong there\n","1488: But it's not enough to go, we have to lock that capability off from people because we don't trust they would make the right decisions\n","1489: We think it's too complicated for people to do this\n","1490: We think there's too many connections being made\n","1491: Well, that is actually a confession of the problem right there\n","1492: If you think people can't understand it, if you think there are too many communications happening, if you think there's too much complexity in there, it needs to be simplified\n","1493: Just like the President can't control everything like that\n","1494: If you have to be the President of the phone, and the phone is as complex as the United States government, we have a problem guys\n","1495: This should be a much more simple process\n","1496: It should be obvious\n","1497: And the fact that it's not, and the fact that we read story after story, year after year saying all your data has been breached here, this company is spying on you here, this company is manipulating your purchases or your search results, or they're hiding these things from your timeline, or they're influencing you or manipulating you in all of these different ways\n","1498: That happens as a result of a single problem\n","1499: And that problem is inequality of available information\n","1500: They can see everything about you, they can see everything about what your device is doing and they can do whatever they want with your device\n","1501: You on the other hand, owned the device\n","1502: Well, rather you paid for the device\n","1503: But increasingly these corporations own it\n","1504: Increasingly these governments own it\n","1505: And increasingly we are living in a world where we do all the work right, we pay all the taxes, we pay all the costs, but we own less and less and nobody understands this better than the youngest generation\n","1506: Well, it seems like our data became a commodity before we understood what it was\n","1507: It became this thing that's insanely valuable to Google and Facebook and all these social media platforms\n","1508: Before we understood what we were giving up, they were making billions of dollars\n","1509: And then once that money is being earned, and once everyone's accustomed to the situation, it's very difficult to pull the reins back\n","1510: It's very difficult to turn that course around precisely because the money then becomes power, right\n","1511: The information then becomes influence\n","1512: That also seems to be the same sort of situation that would happen with these mass surveillance states\n","1513: Once they have the access, it's going to be incredibly difficult for them to relinquish that\n","1514: Right, yeah\n","1515: No, you're exactly correct\n","1516: And this is the subject of the book\n","1517: This is the permanent record, and this is where it came from\n","1518: This is how it came to exist\n","1519: The story of our lifetimes is how intentionally, by design, a number of institutions, both governmental and corporate, realized it was in their mutual interest to conceal their data collection activities, to increase the breadth and depth of their sensor networks that were sort of spread out through society\n","1520: Remember back in the day, intelligence collection in the United States, even at Sigma, used to mean sending an FBI agent to put alligator clips on an embassy building or sending in somebody disguised as a workman and they put a bug in a building\n","1521: Or they built a satellite listening site, right? We call these foreign sat or foreign satellite collection\n","1522: We're out in the desert somewhere\n","1523: They built a big parabolic collector, and it's just listening to satellite emissions, right? But these satellite emissions, these satellite links were owned by militaries\n","1524: They were exclusive to governments, right? It wasn't affecting everybody broadly\n","1525: All surveillance was targeted because it had to be\n","1526: What changed with technology is that surveillance could now become indiscriminate\n","1527: It could become dragnet, it could become bulk collection, which should become one of the dirtiest phrases in the language, if we have any kind of decency\n","1528: But we were intentionally this was intentionally concealed from us, right? The government did it\n","1529: They used classification, companies did it\n","1530: They intentionally didn't talk about it\n","1531: They denied these things were going, they said, you agreed to this and you didn't agree to nothing like this, I'm sorry, right? They go, we put that terms of service page up, and you click that\n","1532: You clicked a button that said, I agree, because you were trying to open an account so you could talk to your friends\n","1533: You were trying to get driving directions, you were trying to get an email account\n","1534: You weren't trying to agree to some 600 page legal form\n","1535: Even if you read, you wouldn't understand\n","1536: And it doesn't matter even if you did understand, because one of the very first paragraphs and it said, this agreement can be changed at any time unilaterally without your consent by the company, right? They have built a legal paradigm that presumes records collected about us do not belong to us\n","1537: This is sort of one of the core principles on which mass surveillance, from the government's perspective in the United States is legal\n","1538: And you have to understand that all the stuff we talked about today, the government says everything they do is legal, right? And they go, so it's fine\n","1539: Our perspective as the public should be, well, that's actually the problem, because this isn't, okay? The scandal isn't how they're breaking the law\n","1540: The scandal is that they don't have to break the law\n","1541: And the way they say they're not breaking the law is something called the third party doctrine\n","1542: A third party doctrine is a legal principle derived from a case in, I believe, the 1970s called Smith versus Maryland\n","1543: And Smith was this knucklehead who was harassing this lady, making phone calls to her house\n","1544: And when she would pick up, he just, I don't know, sit there, heavy breathing, whatever, like a classic creeper\n","1545: And it's terrifying, this poor lady\n","1546: So she calls the cops and says, one day I got one of these phone calls, and then I see this car creeping past my house on the street, and she got a license plate number\n","1547: So she goes to the cops, and she goes, Is this the guy? And the cops again, they're trying to do a good thing here\n","1548: They look up his license plate number, and they find out where this guy is, and then they go, well, what phone number is registered to the house? And they go to the phone company, and they say, can you give us this record? And the phone company says, yeah, sure, and it's the guy\n","1549: The cops got their man, right? So they go arrest this guy, and then in court, his lawyer brings all this stuff up, and they go, you did this without a warrant\n","1550: So that was the problem, was they went to the phone company and they got the records without a warrant\n","1551: They just asked for it, or they subpoenaed it, some lower standard of legal review, and the company gave it to him and got the guy\n","1552: They marched him off to jail, and they could have gotten a warrant, right? But it was just expedient\n","1553: They just didn't want to take the time\n","1554: The small town cops, you can understand how it happens\n","1555: They know the guy's a creeper\n","1556: They just want to get them off to jail\n","1557: And so they made a mistake\n","1558: The government doesn't want to let it go\n","1559: They fight on this, and they go, they weren't his records\n","1560: And so because they didn't belong to him, he didn't have a Fourth Amendment right to demand a warrant be issued for them\n","1561: They were the company's records, and the company provided them voluntarily, and hence, no warrant was required because you can get whatever you want without a warrant as long as it's yours\n","1562: Now, here's the problem\n","1563: The government extrapolated a principle in a single case of a single known, suspected criminal who they had real good reasons to suspect was their guy, and use that to go to a company and get records from them and establish a precedent\n","1564: These records don't belong to the guy, they belong to the company\n","1565: And then they said, well, if one person doesn't have a Fourth Amendment interest in records held by a company, no one does\n","1566: And so the company then has absolute proprietary ownership of all of these records about all of our lives\n","1567: And remember, this is back in the 1970s\n","1568: The Internet hardly exists in these kind of contexts\n","1569: Smartphones don't exist\n","1570: Modern society, modern communications don't exist\n","1571: This is the very beginning of the technological era\n","1572: And flash forward now 40 years, and they are still relying on this precedent about this one pervy creeper to go\n","1573: Nobody has a privacy right for anything that's held by a company\n","1574: And so long as they do that, companies are going to be extraordinarily powerful and they're going to be extraordinarily abusive\n","1575: And this is something that people don't get\n","1576: They go, oh, well, it's data collection, right? They're exploiting data\n","1577: This is data about human lives\n","1578: It is data about people\n","1579: These records are about you\n","1580: It's not data that's being exploited\n","1581: It's people that are being exploited\n","1582: It's not data that's being manipulated\n","1583: It's you that's being manipulated\n","1584: And this is something that I think a lot of people are beginning to understand\n","1585: The problem is the companies and the governments are still pretending they don't understand or disagreeing with this\n","1586: And this reminds me of something that one of my old friends, john Perry Barlow, who served with me at the Freedom of the Press Foundation I'm the president of the board, used to say to me, which is, you can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep\n","1587: He said it's an old Native American thing\n","1588: That's a great expression\n","1589: I think that's a good way to end this\n","1590: Ed, thank you very much for doing this\n","1591: I really appreciate it\n","1592: Please tell everybody the title of your book, and it's available right now\n","1593: Sure\n","1594: Yes, it is\n","1595: It's on shelves everywhere, at least until the government finds some other way to ban it\n","1596: It is called Permanent Record, and I hope you will read it\n","1597: I will read it, and I think what you've done is incredibly brave, and I think you're a very important part of history\n","1598: I think when all is said and done, what you did and what you exposed is going to change the way we view mass surveillance, change the way we view government oversight, and change the way we view the distribution of information\n","1599: I really think it's very important, and it was an honor to talk to you, man\n","1600: Thank you\n","1601: It was my pleasure\n","\n","1602: Thank you so much for having me take care of yourself, man\n","1603: Stay safe\n","1604: No, don't stay safe\n","1605: Stay safe\n","1606: Open\n","1607: Stay free\n","1608: Open the possibility\n","1609: Take care\n","1610: Bye\n","1611: Take care.\n","\n"]}],"source":["for (start, end) in rpt.utils.pairwise([0] + predicted_bkps):\n","
